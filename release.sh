# This bash file is intended to be used for building .deb release files to be
# used by pull and push. To use this file just create your own bash file in
# which you define the APPNAME and DESCRIPTION vars and the
# copy_release_files() function which copies all the files needed in the
# distribution in ${ROOT}. Then source this file after those definitions. The
# resulting .deb will be uploaded to Google Storage with the correct metadata.
#
# Follow Debian conventions for file locations. For example:
#
# HTML Template files in    /usr/local/share/${APPNAME}/
# Binaries in               /usr/local/bin/${APPNAME}
# Small read/write files in /var/local/${APPNAME}/
# Config files in           /etc/${APPNAME}/
#
# The first command line argument to the calling script
# will be used as the 'note' for the release package.
#
# BYPASS_GENERATION
# -----------------
# If BYPASS_GENERATION is set then we know that the caller has created or
# copied in the debian file themselves, and we are to use it as-is. This is
# useful in cases where we are installing software that the author has already
# provided a debian package for, for example grafana.
#
# BYPASS_UPLOAD
# -------------
# If BYPASS_UPLOAD is set then the generated package will not be uploaded to
# to Google Storage. This is meant for debugging.
#
# DEPENDS
# -------
# If DEPENDS is specified it should be a list of dependencies that this package
# depends upon. Note that they will not be installed if missing. If you want
# packages installed beyond the base snapshot they that should be done in the
# startup script. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript
#
# For more details see ../push/DESIGN.md.
#
# SYSTEMD
# -------
# If defined this should be a space separated list of *.service files that are
# to be enabled and started when the package is installed. The target system
# must support systemd. The service file(s) should be copied into
# /etc/systemd/system/*.service in your copy_release_files() function. A
# post-installation script will be run that enables and runs all such
# services.
#
# SYSTEMD_TIMER
# -------------
# If defined it is assumed to contain a systemd timer that will trigger a
# delayed setup and restart of the services. In this case the services
# identified in SYSTEMD are enabled, but not restarted.
# This is useful if a service needs to install a package via apt-get.
# With this delay a systemd unit is triggered after the package is installed.
#
# UDEV_LIB_RELOAD
# ---------------
# If defined the post-install script will reload the udev rules and
# call ldconfig to index added libraries.
