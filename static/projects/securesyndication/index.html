            <h2>Secure Syndication</h2>
            <p>
            Welcome to Secure Syndication. Secure Syndication is a Greasemonkey Script that allows you 
            to read encrypted syndication feeds in you favorite web-based news aggregator.
            </p>

            <p>Install <a href="script/securesyndication.user.js">securesyndication.user.js</a>, the Secure Syndication Greasemonkey script.</p>

            <p>You can test it out in your favorite web-based news 
            aggregator by subscribing to this <a href="index.atom">test feed</a>.
            If SecureSyndication is working correctly then the 
            encrypted content in the div below will be decoded
            and will read: "This is a blowfish encrypted message."
            </p>
               
            <div class="encrypted blowfish" style="color:red;border:solid black 2px;padding:0.3em">
                <p>The following data is encrypted. Please install
                    the SecureSyndication Greasemonkey script to 
                    view the encrypted content.</p>
                    <div class="encdata">WORK:C7FDDC3B50FF0BE0E6F47CBD54AC149FA6E42F1DD9C8AEA48F4D400B6970C14082858FF94901795DBE1C7D380ED6AA16A1B2F8039C6782D604F1CA906A6F1C7CFEB52DED873A557228333D3A6E8B3712BD115C4AC0643B86</div>
            </div>

            <p>If you are interested in generating feeds that have 
            encrypted content that can be read using Secure Syndication
            please read about how the encryption is done, or for 
            a more detailed explaination of how this
            script works please read <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/07/13/secure-rss.html">my article on XML.com</a>.</p>
