Git is distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects.
<p>    At the lowest level in git there are only three operations on the content store:
    Create, read, and delete. 
<p>    Internally, you don't even get to choose the name of
    a file when it is created, all the data is written into
    a file (deflated with zlib) where the filename is the sha1 hash
    of the contents.
