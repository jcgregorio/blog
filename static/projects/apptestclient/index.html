                <h2>APP Test Client</h2>

                <p>The APP Test Client is a GUI based <a href="../atom">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> 
                Client. You can use it to publish content to an APP enabled site.
                It is a validating client, which means that while performing APP operations it will validate the servers 
                operations and the format of the documents transferred.
                It also keeps a log of all transactions. All of this is 
                designed to aid developers in creating APP servers and ensuring that
                those implementations conform to the specification.
                The APP Test Client is written in Python using the wxPython libraries
                and is cross-platform. So far it has been run successfully under
                Linux and Windows.

                <h3>News</h3>

                <p>The latest version has been updated for draft-12 and has some
                additional functionality, such as being able to export
                the diagnostics to a file. Also, the configuration is now stored
                in a traditional INI file format. </p>

                <h3>Download/Installation</h3>

                <p>If you run Windows then the easiest way to get up and running
                   will be to install the binary.
                </p>

                <h4>Windows Binary</h4>

                <p><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestsuite/client/binaries/appeditor-2007-02-03.zip">Download appeditor-2007-02-03.zip</a></p>
                
                <p>If you just want to run the application I have built
                a standalone Windows executable which you can run without having 
                to install Python or wxPython. Just download and unzip.
                Run the executable <tt>appeditor.exe</tt> found in the 'dist' directory. Included in the 
                zip is a <code>config.ini</code> file that automatically connects you
                to my APP Test Server. See below for the INI file format 
                and how to add your own server.
                </p>

                <h4>Pulling the source code</h4>

                <p>
                If you have Python and wxPython already installed you can always
                pull the source directly from subversion and run the 
                application.
                </p>

                <pre><code>$ svn co http://feedvalidator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apptestsuite/client/  apptestclient
...
$ cd apptestclient
$ cp config-example.ini config.ini
$ python appeditor.py 
            </code></pre>

                <p>This works even under Windows, just install Python 2.5
                and the latest version of wxPython for Python 2.5 and you 
                will be ready to run, there are no prerequisites besides 
                those two.
                </p>

                <h3>Config.ini Format</h3>

                <p>The servers that the APP Test Client connects to is controlled
                by the <tt>config.ini</tt> file located in the same directory as 
                the executable. Here is an example config.ini file: </p>

                <pre><code>[APP Test Site]
uri=http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestsite/app.cgi/service/;service_document
name=None
password=None</code></pre>

                <p>Each section in the INI file describes an APP service. The 'uri'
               contains the URI 
                of the Service Document. If the APP service is protected
                then supply 'name' and 'password' parameters in the same section
                of the INI file. You may add any number of APP services 
                to the config file. The APP Test Client uses
                httplib2 for it's connectivity which means that it supports
                the following kinds of authentication:
                Basic, Digest, WSSE, HMAC Digest and Google Account Authentication.
                See the <a href="../httplib2">httplib2</a> documentation for more details.
                </p>

                <p>As always, all the source for both the client and server
                are available and are licensed under an MIT license.
                </p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>It's easiest just to use Python 2.5 and a matching build of
wxPython. If you don't use
Python 2.5 then you will have to install elementtree and possibly 
other modules to get it to run.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>
Send any feedback and bug reports to me at joe@bitworking.org.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The client uses a local module of the feedvalidator
and does not send any content to <a href="http://feedvalidator.org">http://feedvalidator.org</a>.
</p>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<p>
Lots.
