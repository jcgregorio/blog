 * Changed line count rules to permit 58 lines plus
   a <FF><EOL> pair per page.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Oct 2005 22:56:56

idnits (1.80)

 * Added a variation on Author's Address Section Name

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-09-26

idnits (1.79)

 * The code to find and adapt to the particular indentation of a draft
   didn't work as intended.  Rewritten with somewhat better results.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-09-24

idnits (1.78)

 * Added checks for the occurence of both old and new boilerplate.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-09-09

idnits (1.77)

 * In verbose mode, added indication of where in a paragraph boilerplate
   mismatch was found.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-08-21

idnits (1.76)

 * Bugfix: Formfeeds occuring on the same line as the page numbers were not
   counted, which could result in erroneous warnings about missing page
   breaks for some documents.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-08-21

idnits (1.75)

 * Added a "Draft ..." as an acceptable variation on page header.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-07-14

idnits (1.74)

 * Better tests for max and min values of COLUMNS.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-06-21

idnits (1.73)

 * Fixed various nits in the tool, after comments from Bruce Lilly:

 * Adapting to terminal width is now only done up to a maximum width of 76,
   and down to 16

 * Some grammar corrections

 * The column width setting, whether given by the --width switch, by
   setting COLUMNS in the environment, or by running in a narrow terminal
   window, now also applies to boilerplate text

 * The line folding algorithm has been enhanced to not give up as easily

 * All normal output is now folded to match the width setting - previously
   some output lines didn't.  Debug output is not folded.

 * Added additional accepted variations on the names of normative and
   informative sections

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-06-16

 * Added a check for correct year in copyright boilerplate.

idnits (1.70)

 * Changes to discover 3667 boilerplate also when preceded by "This
   document is an Internet-Draft and ..." (so that a warning about imminent
   expiration can be issued).

 * Wording tweaks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-08

idnits (1.67)

 * Added hyphenation warnings again, if it has been possible to extract a
   list of hyphenated words from the draft.  Any fragment of a hyphenated
   word will be accepted on a line-ending, but not hyphenated line-breaks
   which have a line-ending fragment which doesn't occur in a hyphenated
   word somewhere else in the document.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-08

idnits (1.66)

 * "Weird spacing" warnings could result from a long title in the header
   line, which is a mistake.  Fixed.  Also tweaked the code to find the awk
   executable in order to provide a default value for the case when 'which'
   is not available on the target system.  Started some work on extracting
   a list of valid words from the document, for use in validation of
   hypenated line-breaks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-08

idnits (1.65)

 * Disabled hyphenation warnings also in verbose mode.  One slight tweak to
   suit cygwin better.

idnits (1.64)

 * Para. 2 of the 3978 Section 5.4 boilerplate wasn't recognised when occuring
   in a separate paragraph.  Fixed, thanks to Bruce Lilly.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-05

idnits (1.63)

 * A warning has been added for drafts which use 3667 boilerplate instead of
   3978 boilerplate (where those differ).  The 3978 boilerplate is now also
   required to be verbatim, with none of the slight variations which was
   accepted earlier (e.g., "he" in stead of "he or she", or "the author"
   instead of "each author").

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-04

idnits (1.62)

 * RFC 3978 has the copyright notice and the reference to BCP 78 in separate
   paragraphs.  Fixed this.  Also added "export LC_ALL=C" to guard against
   bugs due to untested locale settings.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-03-09

idnits (1.61)

 * Changed references to 3667/3668 to 3978/3979

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-03-02

idnits (1.60)

 * Disabled the hyphenation warnings.  The new xml2rfc (v1.29rc3) does
   line-breaking on hyphens, which is good, but makes it necessary to find a
   more sophisticated algorithm in order not to produce too many spurious
   warnings.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-02-21

idnits (1.59)

 * Added normalisation of draft indentation, to be less sensitive to oddly
   indented drafts.

 * cygwin doesn't by default understand the 'which' command - replaced it with
   'type -p'.

 * Fixed a line folding bug and corrected the
   boilerplate output.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-12-11

idnits (1.56)

 * Tweaked the boilerplate-matching
   regexps a bit, to cover more valid variants.
   (largely from a patch from Bruce Lilly)

idnits (1.55)

 * Fixed a rather annoying bug introduced
   in 1.54, which resulted in the web-service
   printing the full environment and program code
   before getting around to printing the proper
   output...

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-12-10

idnits (1.54)

 * Quite a bit of refactoring, and some new features.

 * If output is to a tty, line-wrapping of error
   and warning messages is now done based on the
   width (number of columns) of the controlling
   tty, as reported by `stty size`.

 * Indentation has been changed somewhat, and
   nits are now prefaced with an asterisk (*)
   while warnings are prefaced with a dash (-).

 * Fixed an error where some tests would not be
   run if multiple files were given as input, and
   the first would have an rfc file name.

 * Fixed several problems associated with using
   nawk instead of gawk as awk interpreter.
   Running under stock solaris, without gawk, should
   now work.

 * Added final full stop to a lot of sentences

 * Fixed grammar of messages, so single and plural
   instances of error and warnings get appropriate
   verb and noun conjugations.

 * Added a "--width <number>" switch, mostly in
   order to control regression testing.  It
   overrides the detected terminal width.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-12-09

idnits (1.53)

 * Permitted IANA Considerations to be placed
   as an appendix.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-12-05

idnits (1.52)

 * Some minor message text changes.  Added
   regression tests so that now the Makefile runs
   tests on darwin, linux and solaris for each new
   release.  Cygwin tests will come when I have a
   windows box online.  As a result, some issues
   were discovered for solaris:

 * The default awk is the original awk, so we
   need to search for gawk and nawk.  The
   original awk unfortunately won't do.

 * Even with nawk, there are some issues -
   those have been fixed, so this version should
   run on at least solaris 8 and higher without
   any problems.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-12-02

idnits (1.51)

 * Some restructuring and changes of
   output layout to better present checks against
   multiple requirements documents.  Added
   1id_guidelines.txt check for:

 * Additional required boilerplate

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-11-26

idnits (1.50)

 * Started process of adding checks for
   all checkable nits - not only those from
   ID-Checklist.html, but also:
   rfc 2223
   draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-08
   http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt

   In this version, added the following:

   1id-guidelines.txt:

 * max 58 lines per page, followed by form feed

   [ The section on formatting is not checked by
   this version, but is planned for a later version.
   as are these items:

     - "INTERNET-DRAFT" should appear in the upper
       left-hand corner of the first page
     - Does not use any of the terms Standard,
       Proposed, Draft, Experimental, Historic,
       Required, Recommended, Elective, or
       Restricted in the title ]

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-11-22

idnits (1.49)

 * Re-wrote the linebreaking regexp as a
   function to avoid awk complaints under OS X.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-11-15

idnits (1.48)

 * Removed regexp metachars from the text
   shown as expected boilerplate in verbose mode.
   Improved the handling of whitespace when
   comparing draft text with boilerplate.  Other
   minor tweaks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-11-14

idnits (1.47)

 * The checknits awk script has become too
   long for the command line of cygwin.  Adding
   workaround by placing it in a temporary file.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-11-02

idnits (1.46)

 * Added "Contact Information" as an
   alternative section name of the Authors'
   Addresses section

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-10-25

idnits (1.45)

 * Added check for IANA considerations section.

idnits (1.44)

 * Minor tweak of Table of Contents regexp.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-10-01

idnits (1.43)

 * Changed base assumption for boilerplate
   compliance to be that the draft is complying
   with 3667, rather than 2026.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-24

idnits (1.42)

 * Fixed a bug introduced in v1.31, where
   some verbose output was never emitted.
   Removed reporting of 2026 deficiencies, unless
   the --rfc2026 option is given.

 * Doing case-independent checks of section names.

idnits (1.40)

 * Minor tweak of page header/footer stripping

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-20

idnits (1.39)

 * Improved the page header/footer
   stripping to handle more cases of paragraphs
   split over page breaks, and a greater variety
   of whitespace in the page break.  Tweaked the
   verbose output format slightly.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-18

idnits (1.38)

 * Added a tiny tweak to the rfc3667_claim
   regexp, to make paragraph merging work for it.
   idnits now correctly validates the output of
   xml2rfc 1.25, which merges this claim with the
   3667 section 5.1 IPR Disclosure Ack.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-18

idnits (1.37)

 * Added more diagnostic information for the
   case where there is a boilerplate mismatch, but
   the start of the boilerplate matches: Now
   showing both the expected pattern and the found
   text.  Tweaked the header/footer stripping
   regexps to handle more variations.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-17

idnits (1.36)

 * Major overhaul of boilerplate matching
   mechanism.  idnits is now attempting to match
   run-together paragraphs containing multiple individual
   boilerplate elements.  This should make it correctly
   accept more documents.  Most basic examples of
   run-together boilerplate should be handled with this
   release.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-12

idnits (1.35)

 * Added some newlines for nicer verbose
   mode output.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-08

idnits (1.34)

 * Not warning for capital 'O' in "Table
   Of Contents". Started restructuring needed to
   support detection of run-together boilerplate
   paragraphs. Added output of expected
   boilerplate pattern in --verbose mode when
   boilerplate mismatch found.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-07-28

idnits (1.33)

 * Added new alternative boilerplate for
   rfc 3667 Section 5, para 1, and fixed a bug in
   detecting bad boilerplate for this paragraph.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-07-09

idnits (1.32)

 * Disabled rfc2026 acceptance.  Added
   "or will be disclosed, " to the initial 3667 IPR
   statement.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-07-02

idnits (1.31)

 * Added check for run-together boilerplate
   paragraphs (first stage - not complete yet).  Changed
   help text to reflect the new ID-checklist document
   which replaces ID-nits.  Made the line numbers
   reported in verbose mode come out correct.  Changed
   output format for verbose mode to be editor-friendly.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-29

idnits (1.30)

 * Further changes to work correctly also
   on \*BSD and Solaris.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-14

idnits (1.29)

 * Changed the reporting of the filename
   and the invocation of Awk in order to work
   under {Open|Free}BSD

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-13

idnits (1.28)

 * Added a check for number of lines to
   the missing ToC test, for drafts which don't
   have page breaks.  Tweaked the Author's address
   detection.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-13

idnits (1.27)

 * Some changes in wording of warnings
   regarding 2026 vs. 3667/3668 boilerplate

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-09

idnits (1.26)

 * Not complaining about too long lines when the
   excess is only blank space.
 * Added --verbose switch
 * Reduced complaints about

       - too long lines
       - non-ascii characters
       - hyphenation
       - control characters
       - spacing

   to a single line when not --verbose used

 * Added a warning for claiming conformance with
   2026 but using 3667/8 boilerplate
 * Lines with "........" before intro indicates
   Table of Contents
 * Now permitting "Security Consideration" (no 's')
 * Minor code tweaks

idnits (1.25)

 * Minor tweaks

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-20

idnits (1.24)

 * The test for numbered reference to RFC 2026
   having been added to the boilerplate was not quite
   right.  Changed, and the diagnostic message
   updated.  Fixed page counting which was broken
   by the v1.23 changes.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-15

idnits (1.23)

 * Added stripping of header/footer lines, in
   order to be able to correctly recognize boilerplate
   which has been split across pages.
 * Improved regexps for boilerplate paragraphs.
 * Added notes when a boilerplate section doesn't
   match, but the start of it matches - could be just a
   boilerplate error then.
 * Did a little code refactoring.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-15

idnits (1.22)

 * Another take on the 3667 vs. 2026 issue.  This
   version observes whether there are 2026 compliant
   sections in the document, and if so notes this and
   verifies against 2026, otherwise it verifies against
   3667. The --no3667 and --rfc3667 switches are no-op's
   in this version.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-08

idnits (1.21)

 * Added tests for the notices required by RFC
   2026.  The handling of 3667 vs. 2026 notices is not
   necessarily perfect - feedback from users would be
   good... :-)  

   Currently, by default idnits looks for 3667
   compliance.  If it doesn't find it, but finds
   equivalent 2026 paragraphs, it notes this when
   pointing out the 3667 non-compliance.  Checking for
   2026 compliance instead of 3667 compliance can be
   done by specifying --no3667.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  		Currently, by default

idnits (1.20)

 * Minor tweaks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-08

idnits (1.19)

 * Added tests for the notices required by
   RFC 3667 and 3668.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-07

idnits (1.18)

 * Case independent matching of section
   names is now used when the --nowarn flag has
   been specified. This functionality requres the
   awk used to be 'gawk' - other implementations
   of awk will most likely still do case-dependent
   matching.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-07

idnits (1.17)

 * tweaked the regexp for weird spacing a bit,
   to avoid trigging on lists with 'o' bullets.  Changed
   the usage and help output somewhat.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.16)

 * idnits is now a SHELL script which starts awk,
   rather than being an awk script directly.  This
   change was done in order to permit giving option
   switches directly, without having to add "--" before
   the switches.
 * added --nowarn option.  With this option,
   only nits according to the ID-nits page ar reported.
   Withouth it, some warnings about misspelling etc. are
   given.
 * Added test for unknown options
 * Also fixed a bug resulting in incorrect line
   numbers when processing multiple files .

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.15)

 * Added a slew of new variations on the name of
   the Introduction section, and some other section name
   variations.  All warnings now occurring when run on
   RFC 3600-3742 now seems to be correct and make sense.
   Also zeroed all counters on new filename - required
   for correct operation on multiple files...

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.14)

 * Accepting another variant on 'Table of
   Contents' spelling.  Added a warning for misspelling,
   though.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.13)

 * Added diagnostic for another misspelling of
   Authors' Address(es)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-04

idnits (1.12)

 * Added another test for table of contents.
   Tweaked some diagnostics' wording.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-03

idnits (1.11)

 * Added printing of program version as first
   output line.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-02

idnits (1.10)

 * Now accepting more variations of the names of
   requried sections.  Added missing newline after
   hyphenation warning.  Refined test for split
   references.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-02

idnits (1.09)

 * Some tests did not work with files
   having DOS line ending - fixed. Added more
   informative diagnostics for non-ascii characters
   and control characters.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-01

idnits (1.08)

 * Refined the test for normative /
   informative references somewhat.  Added the
   ability to sensibly handle the case of multiple
   files given on the command line. Added "No nits
   found" output when no nits were found.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-30

idnits (1.07)

 * Handling some cases of misspelling.
   Some versions of gawk can't handle \000 in
   patterns, changed that to \001 on line 137.
   Only requireing the first Abstract / Status of
   Memo section to be un-numbered.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-18

idnits (1.06)

   section split (code contributed by Pekka Savola)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-16

 * Fixed incorrectly quoted single
   aphostrophes which messed up the test for
   Author's addresses

idnits (1.04)

 * Added --help output

   hyphenation, numbered Abstract /Status of Memo
   section, presence of required sections, some
   3667 checks.
