Abstract

   This memo presents a protocol for using XML (Extensible Markup
   Language) and HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) to edit content.

   The Atom Publishing Protocol is an application-level protocol for
   publishing and editing Web resources belonging to periodically
   updated websites.  The protocol at its core is the HTTP transport of
   Atom-formatted representations.  The Atom format is documented in the
   Atom Syndication Format 0.3 PRE-DRAFT

1.  Introduction

   The Atom Publishing Protocol is an application-level protocol for
   publishing and editing Web resources.

1.1  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", the and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

1.2  Terminology

   Atom Entry: An Atom Entry is a fragment of a full Atom feed.  In this
      case, the fragment is a single 'entry' element and all its child
      elements.  Each Atom Entry describes a single Web resource,
      providing metadata and optionally a textual representation of that
      resource.
   PostURI: A URI that is used to create new resources.  POSTing an Atom
      Entry to this URI will create a new resource.
   EditURI: A URI that is used to edit a resource.  The editing is done
      using the HTTP verbs GET, PUT and DELETE.  The representation of
      the resource is always that of an Atom Entry.
   FeedURI: The URI which identifies an Atom Feed.

2.  The Atom Publishing Protocol Model

   The Atom Publishing Protocol is an application-level protocol for
   publishing and editing Web resources.  Using the common HTTP verbs
   provides a pattern for working with all such Web resources:
   o  GET is used to retrieve a representation of a resource or perform
      a read-only query.
   o  PUT is used to update a known resource.
   o  POST is used to create a new dynamically-named resource.
   o  DELETE is used to remove a resource.

   There are three major classes of URIs in this specification: PostURI,
   FeedURI and EditURI.  This specification defines the expected actions
   for each of the methods listed.  A URI MAY support methods not listed
   here.  For example, an EditURI could support a POST or OPTIONS
   method.  However, what those methods do is beyond the scope of this
   specification.
   o  EditURI: PUT, GET, DELETE
   o  PostURI: POST
   o  FeedURI: GET

   This document does not specify the form of the URIs that are used.
   The URI space of each server is controlled, as defined by HTTP, by

   the server alone.  What this document does specify are the formats of
   the files that are exchanged and the actions that can be performed on
   the URIs embedded in those files.

3.  Functional Specification

3.1  PostURI

   The PostURI is used to create entries.  These can be either full
   entries, such as a weblog post, or they can be comments, or even a
   wiki page.  The client POSTs a filled-in Atom Entry to this URI.  If
   the request is successful, one or more Web resources MAY be created.
   For example, POSTing an Atom entry to a PostURI may create two new
   Web resources, an HTML representation and an Atom representation.

3.1.1  Locating the PostURI

   The PostURI can be discovered in a link element with an @rel of
   'service.post'.  The link element containing a PostURI used to create
   a new entry MAY be discovered in three different places.  The first
   place it may be found is in a <link> element in the 'head' element of
   an HTML document.

   The second place a PostURI may be found an atom:link element that is
   a child of the atom:feed element.  The third place a PostURI may be
   found is in the atom:link element of an atom:entry.

   @@ TBD @@ - Discuss subordinate resources and what a PostURI means
   based on where the URI was found.

   <link rel="service.post"
         type="application/atom+xml"
         href="URI for Posting goes here"
         title="The name of the site.">

3.1.2  Request

   The request contains a filled-in Atom entry, subject to the
   constraints in section Section 3.5.

3.1.3  Response

   The possible status codes from a POST are 201, 303, 400, 401, 404,
   410 and 500.

3.1.3.1  Response code 201

   Response includes a Location: header with the URI of the created

   resource, i.e.  the URI used to edit the entry, as opposed to the URI
   used to display the content.  The body of the response will contain
   the entry "filled-in" with time stamps and any other data the server
   chooses to reveal.  This must contain enough information to enable a
   client to issue a subsequent PUT to this location.  Note that the
   server may chose to omit the content in the response, particularly if
   it is large.

3.1.3.2  Response code 303

   The body of this response does not contain the filled-in Entry, but
   the filled-in Entry can be found under a different URI and can be
   retrieved using a GET method on that resource.  The URI SHOULD be
   given by the Location field in the response.

3.1.3.3  Response code 400

   Indicates that the server believes that that data sent constitutes an
   invalid request.  A short description of the error will appear on the
   <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1>
   itself.  A longer description will appear in the body.

3.1.3.4  Response code 500

   Indicates that the server detected an internal error on the server
   processing this request (such as an unhandled exception).  A short
   description of the error will appear on the
   <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1>
   itself.  A longer description will appear in the body.

3.2  EditURI

   An EditURI is used to edit a single entry.  Each entry that is
   editable MUST have a unique URI.  This URI supports both GET and PUT
   and they are used in tandem for an editing cycle.  The client GETs
   the representation which is formatted as an Atom entry.  The client
   may then update the entry and then PUT it back to the same URI.  The
   PUT will cause all the related resources to be updated, for example,
   the HTML representation.

   Note that the value of the content element in the Atom entry does not
   have to exactly match the content element for the same entry when it
   is represented in an Atom feed.  For example, a server may allow the
   client to post entries whose content is formatted as WikiML, yet the
   server may clean up such markup and transform it into well-formed
   XHTML before placing it in the publicly available Atom feed.  Another
   scenario is summaries--the EditURI is for editing the full content of
   an entry, but the server may only present excerpts when it produces

   an Atom feed.

   A client will send a DELETE to the EditURI to delete an entry.

3.2.1  Locating

   For editing a site Entry, the link tag is used.  Note that a link tag
   is used in both HTML and in the Atom format.  A link tag of the
   following format points to the EditURI for a site.  In HTML, the link
   tags for editing are always found in the head element, while in Atom
   they may appear as children of the entry elements.

   <link rel="service.edit"
         type="application/atom+xml"
         href="URI for Editing goes here"
         title="Readable desc of the entry.">

   Note: The critical characteristic of this link tag is the @rel of
   'service.edit' and the @type of 'application/atom+xml'.

3.2.2  Request

   A PUT request, and a GET response both contain a filled-in Atom
   entry, subject to the constraints in section Section 3.5.

3.3  FeedURI

   The FeedURI is used to retrieve a representation in Atom format.
   Note that this feed is different from a typical Atom feed in that it
   contains "link" elements for navigating and manipulating the content
   of the site.  For example there should be a "link" element with
   rel="next" whose URI points to the next block of entries on the site.
   Similarly, the feed element can contain a "link" element with
   rel="service.post", the URI of which is a PostURI.  Individual
   entries should contain "link" elements with rel="service.edit" whose
   URIs are EditURIs.

   @@ Editor's Note: @@ Note that the "service.feed" takes the place of
   the Introspection File and the Search facet in previous versions of
   the specification.  That is, facet discovery, which was previously
   done by inspecting the Introspection file is now done by looking for
   "link" tags with an attribute "rel" set to "service.[something]" in
   the "service.feed" file.  At the same time the same representation
   replaces the search facet by having "link" tags that point to other
   feeds using well knows 'rel' attribute values such as 'next' and
   'prev', or the search can branch in multiple directions by specifying
   multiple link tags with rel="service.feed" and having differing title
   attributes that announce the kind of search results in that feed.

3.3.1  Locating

   A link tag of the following format points to the FeedURI.

   <link rel="service.feed"
         type="application/atom+xml"
         href="URI goes here"
         title="The name of the site.">

3.3.2  Request

   The request is a simple GET.  No other verbs are currently specified
   for this URI.

3.3.3  Response

   The expected status codes from a GET are 200, 301, 307, and 500.
   401, 404, and 410 are also possible.

3.3.3.1  Response code 301

   The Feed has moved permanently, the new URI is given in the Location
   header.

3.3.3.2  Response code 307

   The Feed has moved temporarily, the new URI is given in the Location
   header.

3.4  Link Tag

   The link tag is used in both HTML and Atom formats.  There are slight
   differences between the two usages.  Here are the commonalities,
   differences, and a list of well-known values for the rel attribute.

   <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#edef-LINK> appears in
   the 'head' of the document.  The 'head' section only allows a linear
   list of 'link' tags.  The Atom format allows 'link' tags as children
   of both the 'feed' element and of the 'entry' element.  Note that
   this gives the information present in the link tag more context.  For
   example ...  @@ TBD @@

3.4.1  rel

   This attribute describes the relationship from the current document,
   be it HTML or Atom, to the anchor specified by the href attribute.
   The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.
   Note that these values are case insensitive.  When used in concert

   with type="application/atom+xml", the relations may be interpreted as
   follows.
   alternate: The URI in the href attribute points to an alternate
      representation of the containing resource.
   start: The Atom feed at the URI supplied in the href attribute
      contains the first feed in a linear sequence of entries.
   next: The Atom feed at the URI supplied in the href attribute
      contains the next N entries in a linear sequence of entries.
   prev: The Atom feed at the URI supplied in the href attribute
      contains the previous N entries in a linear sequence of entries.
   service.edit: The URI given in the href attribute is used to edit a
      representation of the referred resource.
   service.post: The URI in the href attribute is used to create new
      resources.
   service.feed: The URI given in the href attribute is a starting point
      for navigating content and services.

3.4.2  href

   URI of the resource being described by this link element.

3.4.3  title

   Offers advisory information about the link.  Rendered to the user to
   help them choose among a set of links with the same rel and type
   attributes.

3.4.4  type

   The content type of the resource available at the URI given in the
   href attribute of the link element.  Most of the link types in this
   specification are on type 'application/atom+xml'.

3.5  Atom Request and Response Body Constraints

   The Atom format is used as the representation of all the resources in
   this specification.  As it is used in differing contexts, there are
   different constraints of which elements may be present, and how their
   values should be interpreted.

      PUT MAY be present.  The server may or may not accept an updated
         value.  If the server does not allow updating the issued time
         then any PUT request with a different issued value MUST be
         rejected.

3.5.9  author

   PostURI MAY be present.  If not present, the server determines the
      author.  If present, and conflicting with valid values as
      determined by the server, then the server may change the value of
      author.

4.  Security Considerations

   Because Atom is a publishing protocol, it is important that only
   authorized users can create and edit entries.  The security of Atom
   is based on HTTP Digest Authentication and/or the WSSE-style
   authentication described in this document.  Any weaknesses in either
   of these two protocols will obviously affect the security of the Atom
   publishing protocol.

   Both HTTP Digest Authentication and the WSSE-style authentication
   described in this document are susceptible to dictionary-based
   attacks on the shared secret.  If the shared secret is a password
   (instead of a random string with sufficient entropy), an attacker can
   determine the secret by exhaustively comparing the authenticating
   string with hashed results of the public string and dictionary
   entries.

   See RFC 2617 for more detailed description of the security properties
   of HTTP Digest Authentication.

   @@TBD@@ Talk here about using HTTP basic and digest authentication.

   @@TBD@@ Talk here about denial of service attacks using large XML
   files, or the billion laughs DTD attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Appendix A - SOAP Enabling

   All servers SHOULD support the following alternate interface
   mechanisms to enable a wider variety of clients to interact with Atom
   Publishing Protocol servers.  The following requirements are in
   addition to the ones listed in the Functional Specification Section.
   If a server supports SOAP Enabling then it MUST support all of the
   following.

6.1  Servers

   1.  All servers MUST support the limited use of the SOAPAction HTTP
       Header as described below in the Client section.
   2.  All servers MUST be able to process well formed XML.  Servers
       need not be able to handle processing instructions or DTDs.
   3.  Servers MUST accept content in a SOAP Envelope, and if they
       receive a request that is wrapped in a SOAP Envelope then they
       MUST wrap their responses in SOAP envelopes or produce a SOAP
       Fault.

6.2  Clients

   1.  Clients SHOULD use the appropriate HTTP Method when possible.
       When not possible, they should use POST and include a SOAPAction
       HTTP header which is constrained as follows:
   2.  SOAPAction: "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/http/[METHOD]"
   3.  Where [METHOD] is replaced by the desired HTTP Method.
   4.  Clients MAY wrap their XML payload in a SOAP Envelope.  If so,
       they must also wrap it in an element which exactly matches the
       HTTP Method.

7.  Appendix B - Examples

7.1  Example for a weblog

   Fill this in with an example for how all the above is used for a
   weblog.  Start with main HTML page, link tag of type service.feed to
   the 'introspection' file.  1.  Creating a new entry 2.  Finding an
   old entry 3.  editing an old entry 4.  commenting on a entry (via
   HTML and Atom)

7.2  Example for a wiki

   Fill this in like above but for a wiki.

8.  Revision History

   Rev draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-00 - 5Jul2004 - Renamed the file and
   re-titled the document to conform to IETF submission guidelines.
   Changed MIME type to match the one selected for the Atom format.
   Numerous typographical fixes.  We used to have two 'Introduction'
   sections.  One of them was moved into the Abstract the other absorbed
   the Scope section.  IPR and copyright notifications were added.

   Rev 09 - 10Dec2003 - Added the section on SOAP enabled clients and
   servers.

   Rev 08 - 01Dec2003 - Refactored the specification, merging the
   Introspection file into the feed format.  Also dropped the
   distinction between the type of URI used to create new entries and
   the kind used to create comments.  Dropped user preferences.

   Rev 07 - 06Aug2003 - Removed the use of the RSD file for
   auto-discovery.  Changed copyright until a final standards body is
   chosen.  Changed query parameters for the search facet to all begin
   with atom- to avoid name collisions.  Updated all the Entries to
   follow the 0.2 version.  Changed the format of the search results and
   template file to a pure element based syntax.

   Rev 06 - 24Jul2003 - Moved to PUT for updating Entries.  Changed all
   the mime-types to application/x.atom+xml.  Added template editing.
   Changed 'edit-entry' to 'create-entry' in the Introspection file to
   more accurately reflect it's purpose.

   Rev 05 - 17Jul2003 - Renamed everything Echo into Atom.  Added
   version numbers in the Revision history.  Changed all the mime-types
   to application/atom+xml.

   Rev 04 - 15Jul2003 - Updated the RSD version used from 0.7 to 1.0.
   Change the method of deleting an Entry from POSTing <delete/> to
   using the HTTP DELETE verb.  Also changed the query interface to GET
   instead of POST.  Moved Introspection Discovery to be up under
   Introspection.  Introduced the term 'facet' for the services listed
   in the Introspection file.

   Rev 03 - 10Jul2003 - Added a link to the Wiki near the front of the
   document.  Added a section on finding an Entry.  Retrieving an Entry
   now broken out into it's own section.  Changed the HTTP status code
   for a successful editing of an Entry to 205.

   Rev 02 - 7Jul2003 - Entries are no longer returned from POSTs,
   instead they are retrieved via GET.  Cleaned up figure titles, as
   they are rendered poorly in HTML.  All content-types have been

   changed to application/atom+xml.

   Rev 01 - 5Jul2003 - Renamed from EchoAPI.html to follow the more
   commonly used format: draft-gregorio-NN.html.  Renamed all references
   to URL to URI.  Broke out introspection into it's own section.  Added
   the Revision History section.  Added more to the warning that the
   example URIs are not normative.
