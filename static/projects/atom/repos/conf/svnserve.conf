[general]
### These options control access to the repository for unauthenticated
### and authenticated users.  Valid values are "write", "read",
### and "none".  The sample settings below are the defaults.
### anon-access = write 
# auth-access = write
### This option controls the location of the password database.  This
### path may be relative to the conf directory.  There is no default.
### The format of the password database is:
### [users]
### USERNAME = PASSWORD
password-db = passwd
### This option specifies the authentication realm of the repository.
### If two repositories have the same authentication realm, they should
### have the same password database, and vice versa.  The default realm
### is the path to the repository, relative to the server's repository
### root.
realm = atom
