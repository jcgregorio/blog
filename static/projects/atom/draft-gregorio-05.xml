        <section title="Introduction">
           <t>AtomAPI is an application level protocol for publishing, and editing web resources. 
              AtomAPI unifies many disparate publishing mechanisms into a single, simple, 
              extensible protocol. The protocol at its core is the HTTP transport of an XML payload.

            <t>This document covers the editing of content of a periodically updating website using the 
               HTTP and XML. Many of the XML payloads are in Atom format, which will not be documented here.

            <t>This specification will mirror some of the functionality of the <eref target="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/documentation20.html">Blogger 2.0 API</eref>, which

          <section title="Introspection">
            <t>When editing the content of the website http://example.org/reilly, the first thing to do is find out the 
               servers capabilites. Each server may only implement a subset of this specification, and the 'introspection' file
               lists all the functions that each site supports. This mirrors the <eref target="http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/introspection.html">Server Introspection API</eref>

                   not need to support all the facets in this RFC. Additionally,
                   new facets may be added either through vendor extension or
                   follow-on RFCs. This first example site furnishes only a
                   minimal set of functionality. A more full featured site

		     of an HTML page and is used to indicate a document relationship. For a similar example of using the link tag 
		     to discover a URI, refer to the usage of

             <t>Rev 05 - 17Jul2003 - Renamed everything Echo into Atom. Added version numbers in the Revision history.
	       Changed all the mime-types to application/atom+xml.
	     </t>
             <t>Rev 04 - 15Jul2003 - Updated the RSD version used from 0.7 to 1.0. Change the method of deleting
	      an Entry from POSTing &lt;delete/> to using the HTTP DELETE verb. Also changed the 
	      query interface to GET instead of POST. Moved Introspection Discovery to be up under
	      Introspection. Introduced the term 'facet' for the services listed in the Introspection
	      file.
	     </t>
             <t>Rev 03 - 10Jul2003 - Added a link to the Wiki near the front of the 
	       document. Added a section on finding an Entry. Retrieving an Entry
	       now broken out into it's own section. Changed the HTTP status code for
	       a successful editing of an Entry to 205.
	     </t>
             <t>Rev 02 - 7Jul2003 - Entries are no longer returned from POSTs, instead they are retrieved via GET.
	       Cleaned up figure titles, as they are rendered poorly in HTML. All content-types 
	       have been changed to application/atom+xml.
	     </t>
	     <t>Rev 01 - 5Jul2003 - Renamed from EchoAPI.html to follow the more commonly used format: draft-gregorio-NN.html. Renamed all 
                references to URL to URI. Broke out introspection into it's own section. Added the Revision History section.
                Added more to the warning that the example URIs are not normative.
