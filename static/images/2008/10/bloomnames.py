  A Bloom Filter for tracking 3,000 'names', where 'names' are any
  strings of any length. Can be used to track less than 3,000 names, or more, 
  but going over will increase the false positive rate. This is currently
  tuned for a false positive rate of 1%.

  are used:
  
  Number of hash functions:

  Number of bits in filter array:

  Number of elements added to filter: 
     n = 3,000
