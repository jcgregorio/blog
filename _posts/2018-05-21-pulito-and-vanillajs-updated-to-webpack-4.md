title: Pulito and VanillaJS updated to webpack 4
---

Both [Pulito](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pulito) and [VanillaJS](https://github.com/jcgregorio/vanillajs) have updated to webpack 4.

Additionally both have moved from yarn to npm. While npm still isn't as fast
as yarn, the support for `package-lock.json` files and increased attention to
security and speed are worth the tradeoff.
