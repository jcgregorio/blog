<blockquote><p>
In two weeks we’ll present a paper on the Dynamo technology at SOSP, the prestigious biannual Operating Systems conference. Dynamo is internal technology developed at Amazon to address the need for an incrementally scalable, highly-available key-value storage system. The technology is designed to give its users the ability to trade-off cost, consistency, durability and performance, while maintaining high-availability.
</p>
<p>
Let me repeat this before it gets misunderstood: Dynamo is an internal-only tool. It is <b>not</b> a public web-service and will <b>not</b> be offered through that channel. If there are any questions then they should <strong>not</strong> go to the AWS forums, the AWS evangelists or Amazon PR, as they will be not be able to help you.
