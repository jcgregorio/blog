# Great Famine

The [Great Famine of
1315-1317](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315â€“1317) only
lasted two years, was no where close to the change in climate that we are
looking in the face right now, and it wiped out 10-25% of the population.

One of the things that frightens me most about climate change is that small
changes can have drastic affects and institutions can unravel much more
quickly than anyone imagines. My fear is that by the time things get bad
enough that we need to try things like geoengineering our institutions will
have fallen apart and we'll be incapable of launching such efforts.
