title: ETags This stuff matters

---

  
<p>When the number of hits on the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparklines
   web service</a> topped 100,000 a week I started poking
   around in the logs. I discovered a couple things, including that my
   log statistics package wasn't giving me the whole story.
   Part of the problem may be that my sparklines web service returns
   an ETag with each response.
</p>

  
<p>That ETag allows each client to do a conditional 
   GET request. If the image hasn't changed then
   the server just returns an HTTP status code of 304
   with no response body, which can potentially save a lot of bandwidth.
   Here is a diagram of how ETags work:
</p>
<pre>
   Client                      Server
     |                            |
     +------ GET spark.cgi?d=1 --&gt;|
     |                            |
     |&lt;----- 200 Ok, ETag:"foo" --+
     |       [binary png]         |
     |                            |

     .... time passes ...

     |                            |
     +------ GET spark.cgi?d=1 --&gt;|
     |     If-None-Match:"foo"    |
     |                            |
     |&lt;----- 304 Not Modified  ---+
     |                            |
</pre>
<p>On the first request the client receives 
   the PNG it requested and also receives 
   and stores an ETag. On subsequent 
   requests <b>to the same URI</b> the client
   sends along that ETag in an If-None-Match: 
   header. This turns a regular GET into
   a "conditional" GET (wonder twin powers activate).
   When the server receives that conditional GET, <b>if</b>
   the resource hasn't changed then the response
   returned is a <code>304 Not Modified</code> with no response
   body. If the resource has changed then a <code>200 Ok</code> would be returned.
   Of course, I've simplified the scenario slightly and 
   you should read <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.3.3">RFC 2616</a> 
   for the full story.
</p>
<p>I grepped around in my logs and found the following
   number of hits on the service for a stretch 
   of five days and categorized the results by status code. 
</p>
<table style="text-align:right">
<caption>Hits on the sparklines web service</caption>
<tr style="text-align:center"><th>Day</th> <th>Status 200</th> <th>Status 304</th> <th>Ratio (304/200)</th></tr>
<tr><td>2006-12-11</td> <td> 5222</td> <td> 6195</td> <td>1.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006-12-12</td> <td> 6754</td> <td> 15156</td> <td>2.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006-12-13</td> <td> 3947</td> <td> 16807</td> <td>4.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006-12-14</td> <td> 7667</td> <td> 27592</td> <td>3.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006-12-15</td> <td> 7651</td> <td> 22201</td> <td>2.9</td></tr>
</table>
<p>From that table you can see that about three out of every four
  requests resulted in a 304. That represents a large savings in bandwidth
  and computation time and is done without turning on caching explicitly. That is,
  I have no <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13">Cache-Control: headers</a> which would probably increase
  the savings even more. You can also see that my log statistics
  package was under-reporting the hits and that I am receiving not 100,000, but over 200,000 hits a week.
</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, 200,000 hits a week on the 
sparklines web service is hardly going to drive me into the poor house.
Those images are small and the service represents less than 1% of the total number of bytes my site serves
in a week.
