title: URI Construction versus Hypertext Navigation

---

  
  <p>My latest XML.com column is up, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/04/06/restful.html">Constructing or Traversing URIs?</a>.</p>
<blockquote>"REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of
  resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive
  messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state." <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Efielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5"> [Roy
  Fielding]</a></blockquote>
<p>Of the four interface constraints of REST, the last one, 'hypermedia as the engine of application
  state', is the least utilitzed. This article builds the concept from the ground up, and then 
  applies it to the design of our Bookmark Web Service.</p>
