  <p>I mentioned a while a ago that I thought <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Atom_for_search_results">
Atom would be a good format
  for search results</a>. I also mentioned in the past that
  I thought SOAP was overkill for the Google API and that a REST 
  based alternative would offer many advantages, either 
  in the form that <a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/04/24/google.html">Paul Prescod proposed</a>, or in 
  the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Thoughts_on_the_Google_API">formulation I had put forward</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that's all fine and good for theory. Here is the practice.
   Introducing the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/Google2Atom">
   Google2Atom gateway</a>. This service allows you to
   do simple GET queries on Google and to get the results 
   formatted as an Atom feed. Note that I used Paul's formulation with the
   Google key being passed in via the URI. This has the advantage
   that you can take the resulting URI and do cool things with it,
   for example, plug it into your aggregator.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> To make it easier to experiment with
  the interface the Google Key is no longer required, if you do not
  supply it then the script will use my key.
  In addition a longer description of the service has been 
  added, including the fact that the gateway takes the HTML returned
  by the GooleAPI and uses pyTidy to transform it into well-formed
  XHMTL for inclusion in the Atom feed.</p>
