title: Webmention parsing and formatting is now complete
---

As [Chris suggested](http://stream.boffosocko.com/2018/i-suspect-that-next-with-a-tad-bit-of-parsing), I have gone beyond
[my minimal webmentions](https://bitworking.org/news/2018/01/going-beyond-minimal-webmentions), and thanks to the heavy lifting of
[Will Norris](https://willnorris.com/go/microformats), I got to avoid handwriting a microformats parser in the process.

This is what they should look like in action:
