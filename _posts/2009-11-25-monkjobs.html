            RedMonk Client? Give us a call and tell us what you need. If it seems like
            something our crowd would be interested in, we’ll stick it up on 
            <a href=http://twitter.com/monkjobs>@monkjobs</a> and
            if not we may know someone who fits the bill. If you want us instead to be on
            the lookout for a certain type of person, we’ll keep our eyes peeled for you.
