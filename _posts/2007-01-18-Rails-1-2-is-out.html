title: Rails 1.2 is out

  <blockquote><p>[<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations">DHH</a>] 
<span class="caps">REST</span>, and general <span class="caps">HTTP</span> appreciation, is the star of Rails 1.2. The bulk of these features were originally introduced to the general public in my <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/09/david-heinemeier-hansson-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">RailsConf keynote on the subject</a>. Give that a play to get into the mindset of why <span class="caps">REST</span> matters for Rails.
