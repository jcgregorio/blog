Here are a few articles that are good background on what I am about to
talk about:

  * [The Planet Has Seen Sudden Warming Before. It Wiped Out Almost Everything.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/science/climate-change-mass-extinction.html)
  * [The Insect Apocalypse Is Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html)
  * [Hereâ€™s How Far the World Is From Meeting Its Climate Goals](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html)

In my opinion, after watching climate change research for years and watching
the effects of climate change arrive faster than predicted, and the continual
shortening of timelines for climate change effects, and the fact that we are
nowhere close to cutting emissions fast enough, I firmly believe that climate
change is an existential threat to humans and that we need to start
researching geoengineering strategies for cooling the planet today.

Yes, we still need to research fusion power and move as fast as possible to
wind, solar, and other renewable sources of power, but I don't believe
that we can transition fast enough, and given that we are talking about the
lives of millions, if not billions, of humans on the line, it is morally
irresponsible to not research geoengineering.
