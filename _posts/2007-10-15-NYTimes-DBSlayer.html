<blockquote><p>The DBacesslayer aka DBSlayer aka Släyer (as we like to call it when we're feeling ironically heavy metal) is a lightweight database abstraction layer suitable for high-load websites where you need the scalable advantages of connection pooling. Written in C for speed, DBSlayer talks to clients via JSON over HTTP, meaning it's simple to monitor and can swiftly interoperate with any web framework you choose.

<p>Wow, lots of things to note in there:</p>
<ul>
<li>That's <b>code.nytimes.com</b>.</li>
<li>And the project is hosted on Trac.</li>
<li>With JSON over HTTP as a database interface.</li>
<li>"Written in C for speed." We need a name for those
     languages and libraries that are willing to sully themselves
     with actual C linkage, as opposed to those that want to
     live in a bubble and pay the associated bubble-tax.
  </li>
<li>Did I metion it's from <b>The New York Times</b>?</li>
<li>Oh yeah, and they <a href="http://open.nytimes.com/">
      have a blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've lambasted the NYTimes in the past for their luddite
  approach to the net, only because it's my favorite paper
  and I wanted them to survive the coming 'transition' in 
  journalism. Opening their archives and 
  <a href="http://code.nytimes.com">
    code.nytimes.com</a> give me hope.

    Yeah, the NY Times was actually at OSCON this year with a pretty big presence. One of the guys even hosted an after hours session where a bunch of web newspaper people got together and had a nice discussion.
