title: China - Day 11 and 12 - Guangzhou

---

  <p>The last two days have been real nice, with a little
    bit of time spent touring, even less time working
    on paperwork, and lots of good shopping.</p>
<p>Caden is really doing well, she has been eating well, starting
    to eat solid foods, and is putting away the milk. We are already
    starting to see changes in her from the improved diet, just
    in the last week she has cut two teeth and the hair on the back
    of her head has thickened up dramatically.</p>

  <p>The only two things we've had to do so far for the 
    paperwork have been to get passport photos for Caden
    and a medical exam. The exam isn't really a thorough
    exam, but just meant to ensure that Caden isn't
    bringing TB or some other disease into the US. She
    passed the exam just fine. </p>

<p>On the way back from the exam we passed by a park 
    where these girls were having their lessons
    for a sword dance.</p>

<p>The little bit of touring we did in Guangzhou was
    to visit the Chen Family Temple, then a stop
    at a local bird market and then finally a visit
    to a tea shop.</p>
<p>The Chen Family Temple, built over the years 1890-1894, served
    as both a temple and as a school. Today it is open as a 
    historical site and as a home for the Guangdong Folk Arts
    Museum. Here a young woman is performing a traditional dance
    on the grounds of the temple.</p>

<p>The bird market was crowded, a long line of small shops selling
    birds, bird food, or cages. Birds are popular pets because they
    are small and cost much less to own, in contrast, the yearly license 
    to own a dog can run into the thousands.</p>

<p>Many bird owners gather here everyday to socialize.</p>

<p>The rest of time has been spent playing with Caden and 
    shopping. The quantity, quality and price of stuff here
    is substantially better here than what we found in 
    Chongqing. Lynne had a very long shopping list
    that we are slowly filling out. As planned, we've 
    bought a whole new suitcase just to pack the items
    we've bought.</p>
<p>We do lot of walking, on the tours, to official appointments,
    and when we are doing our shopping. It's nice to get out
    and have so much available within walking distance.</p>
<p>One of the things that has struck me is how mentally tiring
    it is to be here. Everything, and I mean everything is, if not 
    overtly, then subtly, different here. That means that things you
    would not normally notice are constantly rising up to your
    attention, from electrical plugs (I'll post a picture of them tomorrow), 
    to languages (I regularly hear English, Mandarin, Cantonse, and 
    French), to tips (you don't tip in restaurants), to crossing 
    the street.
</p>
<p>Okay, crossing the street, that's a good one. At many intersections
    there are no traffic signals, cars and pedestrians just negotiate their
    way through. The basic idea is to wait
    for a large enough gap in the traffic before beginning to cross,
    but if traffic is moving very slowly, or you are moving with a 
    large group, you just step out into traffic and they'll stop
    to let you cross. More than likely you'll only get across
    one lane at a time, then that lane begins to move while you
    negotiate the next lane. You spend an uncomfortable amount of 
    time standing in the middle of the road
    with cars moving past you both in front and behind.
    Also, personal space for crossing the street is 
    very different than what I am used to in the US and vehicles
    regularly come within inches of you as you cross.
