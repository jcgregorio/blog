title: Programming Language Evolution

---

  
  <p>The ultimate destination of programming language evolution
is lisp-without-parentheses.
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> 
To respond to some of the comments, the use of the 
term 'evolution' was meant to invoke the future, that is, while
there are some languages like Python and Javascript that are
close today, any language that changes over time will become 
more lisp like and that in the end they're all headed
to lisp-like capabilities, but w/o the parenthesis. And yes, I'm sorry
to hurt your feelings, but syntax does matter. 
</p>
<p><b>Update 2:</b> I'm thrilled by all the Forth references. Forth was
actually the third language I learned, after Basic and Pascal. 
That may actually go a long way towards explaining the way I think
about computers and programming languages.

    Forth! 

Not really. Forth uses parenthesis for stack comments. ;^)

Seriously: a lisp-without-parenthesis would still be applicative with prefix notation rather than Lisp's circumfix or Forth's postfix and catenation. That doesn't seem like the ultimate destination to me but then nor does Forth despite the fact I share Aristotle's love for it.

Losing <em>only</em> the parenthesis is like losing the <a href="http://users.rcn.com/david-moon/PLOT/">PLOT</a>.

    I'm not sure I will ever understand this obsession with "lisp has parentheses".

Jesus: "Dear god, we cannot use lisp. It has parentheses! Please deliver us from evil."

God: "OK, my son. Here's ruby. It's a hack. Try writing a correct parser! There's no 'there' there. St. Peter and I gave up. We found it more soothing to go back to lisp."

    Just disassemble it:

Command: (defun ex1 (a b) (* (sin a) (cos b)))
EX1
Command: (compile *)
EX1
Command: (disassemble *)
  0  ENTRY: 2 REQUIRED, 0 OPTIONAL      ;Creating A and B

  4  PUSH FP|2                          ;A 
  5  FINISH-CALL-1-VALUE
  6  START-CALL-INDIRECT-PREFETCH #'COS

    Err... Logo? No, wait, that only gets rid of the outer level of parens and replaces everything else with square brackets.

    Dylan? Smalltalk?<br />
<br />
Patrick Logan: +1. While I prefer Smalltalk, the parens in Lisp were never a problem, it's just another syntax.  Some aspects of Lisp culture on the other hand...

    Perl! Who else has proper closures (including anonymous), maps, lexical scoping and most (all?) of the other fittings?

In mainstream languages, JavaScript and Python are also close, but lacking lexical scoping, and the latter missing anonymous closures as well (and their closures are uglier than *Perl's*, if you can believe that!)...

    The closest thing to "lisp without parenthesis" I've seen in my life is python: functions that return functions, functions that are really objects with a __call__ method,... In particular the fact that functions are evaluated in the same namespace as the rest of the objects gives python a "schemish" flavor I prefer over common lisp with its syntax bloat. If python only had true lexical scope...

Python looks to me quite similar to forth in the way it moves dictionaries around for namespaces too, something again very lispish.
