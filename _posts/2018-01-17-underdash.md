[Underdash](https://surma.github.io/underdash/) is neat project in the same
vein as my [VanillaJS](https://github.com/jcgregorio/vanillajs). While
VanillaJS shows you how to build common web framework sample apps using just
vanilla JS, the Underdash site shows you how to make the most of JS intrinsics
without the need for a JS utility library.
