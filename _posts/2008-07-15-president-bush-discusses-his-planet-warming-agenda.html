title: President Bush Discusses Outer Continental Shelf Exploration

---

  
  <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-4.html">President Bush</a>:</p>
<p>
Good afternoon. Across the country, Americans are concerned
about the high price of gasoline. Every one of our citizens
who drives to work, or takes a family vacation, or runs a
small business is feeling the squeeze of rising prices at the pump.
</p>
<p>
To reduce pressure on prices we must continue to implement
good conservation policies,
</p>
<p class="fisk">Like raising CAFE standards, which I have staunchly opposed during my entire administration.</p>
<p> and we need to increase the
supply of oil,</p>
<p class="fisk">
Because what we need is more oil, not conservation. None
 of this namby-pamby worrying about Global Climate Change for me.
</p>
<p> especially here at home.
</p>
<p class="fisk">Because that whole invading-other-countries-for-their-oil thing hasn't turned out so well.</p>
<p>
 For years, my
administration has been calling on Congress to expand
domestic oil production.
</p>
<p class="fisk">
 Which is another way to say "drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge".</p>
<p> Unfortunately, Democrats on Capitol
Hill have rejected virtually every proposal -- and now
Americans are paying at the pump.
</p>
<p class="fisk">Right, it's the fault of the Democrats, who have only controlled 
  congress by a razor thin margin for 18 months, it's got nothing to do with me or the GOP.
  Higher gas prices have nothing to do with invading Iraq, blocking higher CAFE standards, cutting funding
  for alternative energy research, or the 40 billion barrels of offshore oil 
  in the Gulf of Mexico that the oil companies have failed to develop.
</p>
<p>When members of Congress
were home over the Fourth of July recess, they heard a clear
message from their constituents: We need to take action now
to expand domestic oil production.
</p>
<p class="fisk">With a 9% approval rating, the lowest in history, 
the message the members of Congress should have heard is, "As much
as we dislike President Bush, we dislike you more".</p>
<p>
One of the most important steps we can
take to expand American oil production is to increase access
to offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf, or
what's called the OCS.
</p>
<p class="fisk">That's called an acronym, I just learned that this morning.</p>
<p> But Congress has restricted access to
key parts of the OCS since the early 1980s. Experts believe
that these restricted areas of the OCS could eventually
produce nearly 10 years' worth of America's current annual
oil production. And advances in technology have made it
possible to conduct oil exploration in the OCS that is out of
sight, protects coral reefs and habitats, and protects
against oil spills.
</p>
<p class="fisk">Not that we need to protect the coral reefs from oil spills, they'll all be
   dead from the rising acidification of the oceans due to rising CO2 levels, but
   that's just me, I'm a giver.
</p>
<p>
Last month, I asked Congress to lift this legislative ban and
allow the exploration and development of offshore oil
resources. I committed to lift an executive prohibition on
this exploration if Congress did so, tailoring my executive
action to match what Congress passed. It's been almost a
month since I urged Congress to act -- and they've done
nothing. 
</p>
<p class="fisk">Except completely capitulate on FISA and give retroactive immunity
  to telecoms that spied on Americans, but let's not dwell on the past.
</p>
<p>They've not moved any legislation. And as the
Democratically-controlled Congress has sat idle, gas prices
have continued to increase.
</p><p></p><p>
Failure to act is unacceptable. It's unacceptable to me and
it's unacceptable to the American people. So today, I've
issued a memorandum to lift the executive prohibition on oil
exploration in the OCS. With this action, the executive
branch's restrictions on this exploration have been cleared
away. This means that the only thing standing between the
American people and these vast oil resources is action from
the U.S. Congress.
</p>
<p class="fisk">That and a five year backlog on oil exploration equipment, but let's not
 dwell on the future.</p>
<p>Now the ball is squarely in Congress' court. Democratic
leaders can show that they have finally heard the
frustrations of the American people by matching the action
I've taken today, repealing the congressional ban, and
passing legislation to facilitate responsible offshore
exploration. This legislation must allow states to have a say
in what happens off their shores, provides a way for the
federal government and states to share new leasing revenues,
and ensure the environment is protected.
</p><p></p><p class="fisk">Because now that the GOP is sliding out of power you can
  be sure we're going to start whining about states rights again.
</p>
<p>
This legislation should also take other essential steps to
expand domestic production: Congress should clear the way for
our nation to tap into the extraordinary potential of oil
shale, which could provide Americans with domestic oil
supplies that are equal to more than a century's worth of
current oil imports. Congress should permit exploration in
currently restricted areas of northern Alaska, which could
produce roughly the equivalent of two decades of imported oil
from Saudi Arabia. Congress should expand and enhance our
domestic refining capacity, so that America will no longer
have to import millions of barrels of fully-refined gasoline
from abroad.
</p><p></p><p>
The time for action is now.
</p>
<p class="fisk">Not eight years ago when I started in this job, or 30 
years ago when we had our first energy crisis, but right now.
</p>
<p> This is a difficult period for
millions of American families. Every extra dollar they have
to spend because of high gas prices is one dollar less they
can use to put food on the table or send a child to
school.
</p>
<p class="fisk">or get healthcare. Oh wait, I'm not supposed to mention healthcare.
  Can I get a do-over?
</p>
<p> And they are rightly angered by Congress' failure to
enact common-sense solutions. Today, I've taken every step
within my power to allow offshore exploration of the OCS.
</p>
<p class="fisk">Well, every <b>legal</b> action. I could tell
 the oil companies that they were allowed to drill based solely on my word, and then
 later ask congress to grant them retroactive immunity for 
 their illegal drilling, but that's so yesterday.
</p>
<p> All
that remains is for the Democratic leaders in Congress to
allow a vote. The American people are watching the numbers
climb higher and higher at the pump -- and they're waiting to
see what the Congress will do.
</p>
<p class="fisk">While we're waiting, who's up for a round of golf?

    I'm not sure which concerns me more — that the President of our country is this ignorant or that a significant proportion of the population is ignorant enough to believe him.  That said, the question remains: How do we make it better?

    I was waiting for the "High as a Kite" canned fisking. Oh, and class="fisk" didn't work on the feed reader; maybe Thunderbird strips all styles.

    Luis: Silly rabbit, "high as a kite" is for PR-Speak translations!

...which I sort of guess this is, it just doesn't label itself as if it were.

    This is very confusing to read in a feed reader because the quotations aren’t in <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags. (You can give them a class and use that to undo the block-quote styling in the context of your site if you really want to; personally I think it’d work best to just let the quotes be quotes and your own text be your own text.)

    Please forgive my vulgarity but that was just fucking awesome. It's such a shame it's right on. Surprised you didn't throw in the Enron loophole, though, and the effect of speculation on the price at the pump. Nevertheless, brilliant post. Oh, and I love the slug in the URI (planet warming agenda)...
