title: The shiny parabolic broadcast spreader of vomit

---

  <p>
  Due to suspected food poisoning I checked into the local emergency room last
  night around 2 AM, trusty 13 gallon plastic garbage bag in hand, because,
  I&#39;ve been throwing up. Once they get me into a room the nurse offers
  me a shallow pink plastic pan in exchange for my plastic garbage bag, and
  I&#39;m thinking to myself, &#34;Really, have you never seen anyone
  vomit in your entire life?&#34;. Why on earth would you offer me a
  shallow round bottom plastic pan as an alternative to a 13 gallon plastic
  garbage bag? This is vomit we&#39;re trying to contain here. This reminds me of
  a previous visit to the same ER with my son when he had appendicitis, this
  time we came in with a kitchen garbage pail and the nurse laughed at us and
  handed him a small metal kidney dish. My son held it in his hands, looking at it
  perplexedly for about five seconds before he started vomiting again, turning
  it from a kidney dish into a shiny metal parabolic broadcast spreader of
  vomit.

  I don&#39;t know what to make of this phenomenon, as I thought that
  working in an ER would expose you to a lot of puking people, and thus
  you&#39;d know better than to give someone a kidney dish to throw up in. I
  can only come up with two possible conclusions, the first that the ER folks
  are just aren&#39;t quick learners and haven&#39;t picked up on the
  association:
  </p>
  <pre>kidney dish : vomit :: broadcast spreader : grass seed</pre>

  The other possibility is that my family is unique, maybe my wife and I are both
  descended from long lines of projectile vomitters, a long and honorable
  tradition of high velocity emesis, and that the rest of population is filled
  with polite, low volume, low velocity vomitters. If so, you people make me
  sick.
