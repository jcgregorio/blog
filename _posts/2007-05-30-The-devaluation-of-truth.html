has a fine rebuttal to these histrionics.

<p>The only thing I can add is that I might have more sympathy,
  but unfortunately I can count the number of "professional journalists 
  committed to seeking the truth and reporting it" on one hand.

    My sympathy for journalists meeting the "invisible hand" is definitely tempered by the fact that many of them are so self-important and self-entitled.

A journalist's job is not to reveal The Truth to the ignorant masses; it's to provide a service that customers may or may not be willing to pay for.
