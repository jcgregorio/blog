title: Adam Bosworth on Speaking Up

  <p><a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000047.html">Adam Bosworth</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is wrong. The belief that some imam has that he has the
right to snuff out someone's life through a Fatwa because of their
apostasy or heresy is wrong. The belief that terrorists have that they
have the right to kill and maim and burn innocent people because they
are angry at injustice is wrong. The belief that some governments have
that they have the right to kill and wound their own citizens when they
protest peaceably is wrong. The belief that some Catholic prelates have
that they can dictate what people believe about science is wrong.</p>
<p>It is all akin to letting a child's tantrum dictate the judgement of
an adult. It promotes irrationality over reason and faith over facts.
The reason that homicidal madmen are so frightening is that one cannot
reason with them. No more can one reason with the people who rule on
the school boards in Kansas, the people who bomb innocent people in
buildings and subways, the people who shoot their own citizens for
protesting, or the prelates who presume to tells others how to live
rather than simply choosing that way for themselves and hoping it acts
as an example for others. </p>
<p>It is time to speak up. It is time to say that facts are what
matter, not faith, that human progress is accomplished through
unfettered use of reason and inquiry and tolerance and discussion and
debate, not through intolerant and irrational acts of terror or edicts.
For all of our children and for the future, speak up against this wave
of intolerance and irrationalism washing over the world.</p>
