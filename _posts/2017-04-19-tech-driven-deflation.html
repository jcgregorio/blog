    Each time an object gets digitized that&#39;s one less object to
    manufacture, one less object to ship, one less object consuming
    raw materials. It&#39;s actually more surprising that this hasn&#39;t had
    an even larger impact on the U.S. economy.

      slide deck from Hal Varian</a> covers the same ground with a slightly different take, pointing
    out that much of this progress not only doesn't increase GDP, it actually
    reduces it, which is a problem of using GDP as a metric.
