title: WebHooks

  <p> <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Project Hosting</a> just <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/01/post-commit-web-hooks-for-google-code.html">announced
    support for Web Hooks</a>, which is the first time I've heard of them. Web
Hooks, that is.  Looks very interesting.

You would think my first reaction would be "that would be so much better with
Atom" since you could POST an Atom Entry, but it wasn't.  </p>

    not 100% in agreement with Tim</a>, but I'm a lot closer than I was a few
years ago.  </p>
<p> The current weakness with Web Hooks is that it's just <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com/">an idea, with a general description of
    what to do</a>. Personally I'd prefer a little more rigorous text around
such a thing. That might avoid the need for headers with names like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/PostCommitWebHooks"><code>Google-Code-Project-Hosting-Hook-Hmac:</code></a>.

    Just wondering -- is your being closer to Tim Bray regarding the need for all 4 http verbs vs. just GET/POST, or regarding x-www-form-urlencoded as a good alternative to something like Atom?

    I actually rather like the idea of webhooks.  They're a pragmatic solution to dealing with events in webapps.  That being said, standardizing them a bit might make it a lot easier for people to hook their stuff up...

<p>Agree. I need this for events. Content is a done deal.</p>
