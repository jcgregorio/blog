title: The real value of XML is wellformedness

---

  
  <p>Almost two years ago I switched away from Radio to 
  my own home grown tools for blogging. Because the Radio
  site was statically generated I didn't bother moving all my old content
  into the new system, instead I just
  exported the site data as an XML file in case I needed it at 
  a later date. That file has lain dormant all this time.
  Now I am slowly preparing to move all my content over to pyblosxom
  and started to work with that large exported blob of data.
</p>
<h3>Except</h3>
<p>When I tried to load it into an XML parser it failed to load.
   As it turns out the file was riddled with character set
   encoding problems, in particular quote marks. After much
   hand tweaking I finally have it in shape where a real 
   XML parser can open in up. Now I can get on with the job
   of importing the data into pyblosxom. It isn't supposed to be this hard.
</p>
<p>The real value of XML is interop and the currency of that 
   interop is syntax as expressed in the term "well-formed".</p>
