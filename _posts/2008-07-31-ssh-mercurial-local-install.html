title: Mercurial, SSH, and a local install

---

  
  <p>
I have the latest and greatest version of <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> on
my laptop but the other machines I want to 'push' to
over ssh are either a shared host without Mercurial installed
or are pinned to a release of a distro
that has a very old version of Mercurial.
This means that I had to <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/UnixInstall"><code>$ make install-home</code></a>, 
which leaves me with a problem, 
which is that the installed Mercurial files won't be
on my Python path when I ssh in. That means I see
this when I ssh in from my laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh bitworking.org /home/jcgregorio/bin/hg
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jcgregorio/bin/hg", line 14, in ?
    from mercurial import demandimport; demandimport.enable()
ImportError: No module named mercurial
~
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>
The easiest way I found to fix 
this to add the following two lines to 
the beginning of <code>~/bin/hg</code>
on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/home/jcgregorio/lib/python')
</code></pre>
<p>Then  I need to specify the exact location
   of <code>hg</code> from the command line on the laptop, so it uses
   my locally installed version on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>$ hg push --remotecmd ~/bin/hg ssh://bitworking.org/myproject/
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>--remotecmd</code> can be made to go away if I add it 
  to the config file for the project on the laptop. I created the file 
  <code>.hg/hgrc</code> and added the following lines:
</p>
<pre><code>[ui]
remotecmd = ~/bin/hg
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I can finally run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ hg push ssh://bitworking.org/myproject/
</code></pre>

    I solved the problem by adding a couple of lines to <code>.profile</code> (or <code>.bash_profile</code> or whatever) on my shared host:

<p>
<code>
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH<br />
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
</code>
</p>

You might have to adjust that <code>PYTHONPATH</code> value, though.  Depending on the way you installed Mercurial, it's probably something more like <code>~/lib/python2.5/site-packages</code>.

Is there a reason this won't work for you?

<p>It would probably work, but it's rather invasive as that change would then apply to everything that runs over ssh.</p>

    <p>I, too, went the <em>invasive</em> route.</p>
<p>I don't have root, but <code>~/bin</code> contains all the executables that I have installed, and <code>~/lib/python</code> contains all of the python libraries.  Since all of them are available to me when I ssh in, I can simply forget about the difference between system wide installation and per user installation.  As none of them have been modified, upgrading is a snap.</p>

    Like Sam, I went the invasive route on purpose, because I wanted the software and Python libs I had installed myself to always be used rather than the system-wide software.

Though you could make it slightly less invasive by sticking your personal <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> dirs at the end of the search paths:

<p><code>
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin<br />
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/lib/python
</code></p>

That way your local software/libraries would only be used if they were not available system-wide.

<p>NP, the reason I wrote this up is for people who were looking for a solution.
If they come here and find a few alternatives, all the better!</p>
