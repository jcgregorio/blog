    <p>
    I've been a little self-conscious about our Christmas decorations
    this year. Because of a family vacation earlier this year we didn't 
    get to put up Halloween decorations until the day before Halloween, and
    even then it was a pretty paltry showing. We also didn't get to run our
    haunted house, which was a big disappointment to the rest of the neighborhood.
    We had no idea we'd become such an institution, but we heard from many
    of the trick-or-treaters that they were looking forward to it.

    All of that goes to explain why the day after Thanksgiving we broke
    out the Christmas decorations, something we normally wait until just 
    the week before Christmas to do. There's apparently a yin and yang
    to the decorating effort and we compensated for the lack of Halloween
    by making our best showing ever on the Christmas side. But as I drove
    around I realized we were very early on the decorations and so began
    to feel a little self-conscious about our house.

    <p>Which is why on Thursday, as I was flying back from NYC, as the plane
    banked to turn and make a landing from the south at RDU I looked
    out at the sub-divisions below, scanning for decorations, and was
    rewarded to see a similarly decked out house:

    <blockquote><p>"Hey, we aren't the only ones, there's another house
      with a set of blinking icicles on their front porch and ...
      aww crap, that's <b>my</b> house!</p></blockquote>
