title: Comments Page

---

  
  <p>I've added a <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/comments/">comments page</a> that lists the most recent comments to the site. I used to have a page like this
in the old system, but I'm trying a different format. The problem
with the old view was that the straight list of all comments
and their content made it hard to follow a conversation. This new
view uses the <tt>:hover</tt> CSS Selector to make the comment 
appear to the right as you hover your mouse over each link.
</p>
<p>There is one major and one minor problem with this view. The minor one is that this only works
  in <i>modern</i> browsers, and by <i>modern</i> I mean <b>not Interner Explorer</b>.
  The second, and larger, problem is the lack of any user-interface clues of the capability. 
  That is, unless I told you that hovering over the links will do something, you would never know. 
  I'm pretty sure that hurts accessibility too.
</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    <p>Your most immediate accessibility problem is that you don't display the comments while you're tabbing through the list with the keyboard.  This CSS rule will add the appropriate keyboard support:</p>
<pre><code><strong style="background: black; color: yellow;">a.comment_title:focus + .comment_content,</strong>
.comment_li:hover .comment_content {
 ...
}</code></pre>

    For some reason, when tabbing through the list, I can only get about half way down it before my next "tab" sends me back up to the links in the header.

    Now if you tab to a comment and then move the mouse to over over a different comment, you get to see both -- overlaid.

<p>The problem there was that a comment would appear that contained a link, and the next time you pressed tab the focus would shift to the link. Of course, that would shift the focus <i>away</i> from the comment title, so the content would disappear. Did you watch <a href="http://www.scifi.com/lostroom/">"The Lost Room"</a>? It's just like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, that problem I fixed by setting <tt>display:none</tt> on all links
in the comment, which is crude but effective. Maybe there is a way to set 
<tt>z-index</tt> or something else to move that link to somewhere else in the tab order which would be better.

<p>As a partial solution I changed the background color to white, that way they would overlap, but not overlay. Not optimal, let me know if you think of anything better.

    Discoverability: you can use an always visible container to show that something will be displayed.<p></p> 

That being said, I'm not sure how the overall usability of displaying such items only on mouse hover:
<ul>
<li> You can't scroll down the page to simply scan all comments very quickly.
</li><li> You can't read comments that are taller than the window -- trying to grab the scrollbar makes the comment go away.
</li><li> How exactly does this make it easier to follow a conversation? There's no obvious threading, and no date nor poster name in the list column.
</li></ul>

You could benefit from a different layout combining comments per page and adding a smart shortened date (i.e. time of today/yesterday, etc.):
<ul>
<li><a href="#link-to-page2">Page2 name</a></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="#link-to-comment">11:31, by Doe</a></li>
</ul>
<li><a href="#link-to-page1">Page1 name</a></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="#link-to-comment">11:30, by Doe</a></li>
<li><a href="#link-to-comment">Oct 26, by John</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>

Overall it's a nice page to get a sense of how many recent comments there are rather than actually trying to read them, but then in this case a counter would do almost as good except counters rarely justify for nifty CSS tricks.

<font size="-1">PS: If I keep updating this comment every 4-5 minutes, for how long can I do it? Do you reset the counter at each post? OK that got boring after 12 minutes but you get the idea.</font>

<p>The five minutes is from the 'updated' time on the comment. So yes, you can keep pressing update and keep a comment open forever. The hope is that eventually everyone gets bored like you did.

    <p>Joe, try adding this block of rules to your CSS. It should solve your overlap problem (I've only tested this in Firefox, mind you):</p>
<pre><code>a.comment_title:focus + .comment_content,
.comment_li:hover .comment_content {
   padding: 2em 30px 0 30px;
}
.comment_li:hover .comment_content {
  z-index : 3;
}
.comment_content:after {
  content : "-";
  color : white;
  display : block;
  height : 500px;
  border-top : 3px solid black;
  background : white;
  margin : 2em -33px 0 -33px;
}</code></pre>

    <p>It fixes it by more effectively hiding the comments that might peek below the bottom of the currently <code>:focus</code>ed (or <code>:hover</code>ed) comment. It also places <code>:hover</code>ed comments on a higher <code>z-index</code> layer than the <code>:focus</code>ed comments to make the transition between keyboard and mouse navigation more seamless.</p>
<p>It uses generated content (the <code>:after</code> selector) to create a <code>500px</code> tall white mask with a black top border to add what might be described as a crude "outer-padding" to each comment.</p>
<p>You might of course want to tweak the "<code>500px</code>" height value to better suit your needs - e.g. change it to a relative "<code>em</code>" value, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no suggestions on how to solve the problem of links within comments with just CSS - other than hiding them like you're already doing - which is crude.</p>
<p>I can think of three other sorts of solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server:</strong> Disarm the links out on the server-side</li>
<li><strong>Javascript:</strong> Use Javascript to disarm the links (transmogrify them into, say, <code>&lt;span class="link"&gt;</code>)</li>
<li><strong>HTML:</strong> add a <code>tabindex</code> attribute to the comment-activation links. This will make the keyboard navigation behave more like one would expect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm... now thinking about it, I suggest you try the <code>tabindex</code> method.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. I ended up using a variant of your solution, instead of adding a 500px block after the content, I just fixed the height of the comment_content, which makes <code>:focus</code> and <code>:hover</code> items the same size. I also added an <code>overflow: hidden</code> so that things that got too large get clipped, and I moved the comment author to the beginning so it wouldn't get clipped.</p>
