title: Steve Yegge ports Rails to JavaScript

---

  
  <p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Framework_2_0">
   I have previously pointed out that there is nothing magical about Ruby or Rails</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/steve-yegge-por.html">John Lam</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve decided to do what any other frustrated programmer would do: he ported Rails to JavaScript. Line by line. In 6 months. </p></blockquote>
<p>I'm just glad I didn't have to put in the 2,000 hours of coding myself to prove the point.
</p>
<p>I will note that I don't agree with Steve's assertion that JavaScript is the Next Big Language, 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Next_Java">
  as I disagree with the entire premise of the question itself</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">More on Rhino on Rails from Steve himself</a>.</p>
