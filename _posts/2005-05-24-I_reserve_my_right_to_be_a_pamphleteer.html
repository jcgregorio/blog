title: I reserve my right to be a pamphleteer

  points to a great article by Chris Daly, <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cdaly/whoisajournalist.html">
  Are Bloggers Journalists? Let's ask Thomas Jefferson</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Common Sense</i> and other pamphlets like it were precisely the
kind of political journalism that Jefferson had in mind when he
insisted on a constitutional amendment in 1790 to protect press freedom
-- anonymous, highly opinionated writing from diverse, independent
sources. In historical terms, today's bloggers are much closer in
spirit to the Revolutionary-era pamphleteers than today's giant,
conglomerate mainstream media. On those grounds, blogs deserve the full
constitutional blessings that the First Amendment guarantees.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the next time some nitwit media critic raises the issue let's turn this argument around
   and ask, do corporations, the employers of most
   "Journalists", deserve First Amendment protection, when in fact the 
   First Amendment was really aimed at protecting the pamphleteers?
</p>
<p>BTW, Thomas Paine, and <i>Common Sense</i> were the inspiration for the name of my 
   blogging client, Pamphlet.</p>
