title: W3C Launches Efficient XML Interchange Working Group

---

  
  <p>You know you have problems if you're churning out tortured language like this:</p>
<blockquote><p> The group's objective is to define an alternative encoding of the XML Information Set that addresses the requirements identified in the work of the XML Binary Characterization Working Group, while maintaining the existing interoperability between XML specifications. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course you have to use tortured language to avoid stating the obvious, which is, 
  the W3C is going ahead with Binary XML. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#sec-origin-goals">
  Binary XML groups charter</a>. <span class="rant">{ My comments are in-line and will appear like this. }</span>.</p>
<div class="fisk">
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>The main objective of the Efficient XML Interchange (<abbr title="Efficient XML Interchange">EXI</abbr>) Working Group is to
develop a format that allows efficient interchange of the XML
Information Set, based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-characterization/#N107D4">conclusions
of the XML Binary Characterization Working Group</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope and Goals</h2>
<p>XML has been enormously successful as a markup language for
documents and data,

<span class="rant">{ So let's start screwing with it! }</span>

 but is not an optimal format for all purposes.

<span class="rant">{ Really? You mean it's not a floor wax <b>and</b> dessert topping?
Let's be clear, XML isn't for all applications. If it doesn't fit your
needs <b>don't use it</b>!
 }</span>

The XML Binary Characterization Working Group established a set of use
cases for which XML employment may be problematic. The Efficient XML
Interchange Working Group is chartered to define an alternative
encoding of the <cite>XML Information Set</cite> that
<strong>addresses at least the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-characterization/#N102EC">minimum
requirements</a> identified by the XML Binary Characterization Working
Group</strong>. The Working Group shall also consider properties that
shouldn't be prevented, as listed in the second list of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-characterization/#N1020A">decision
tree</a>. Such support will be considered as extensions to the
<cite>XML Information Set</cite> or extensions introduced in the

<cite>XML Schema 1.0 Post–Schema–Validation Infoset</cite>
and in the <cite>XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 data model</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>The goals of this Working Group are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Fulfill the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#sec-origin-goals">design
goals of XML</a> with the following exceptions: 

<span class="rant">{ Yeah, those goals were too lofty and promoted too much interop. 
What's the new motto at the W3C? "Aim low?" }</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The interchange format must be compatible with the XML
  Information Set instead of being “compatible with SGML” (XML goal
  3); <span class="rant">{ Interop? We don't need no steeenking interop... }</span>
</li>
<li>For performance reasons, the format is not required to be
  “human–legible and reasonably clear” (XML goal 6);
  <span class="rant">{ Because no one ever needs to debug services. We'll all have
  perfect libraries for that. The tools will save us! The tools will save us! }</span>
</li>
<li>Terseness in efficient interchange is important (XML Goal 10).
   <span class="rant">{ Hijacking popular specifications is easier
   than coming up with something new on our own. }</span>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Address all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-characterization/#N102EC">requirements</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-use-cases/">use cases</a> from the
XML Binary Characterization Working Group;</li>
<li>Maintaining the existing interoperability between XML
applications, as well as XML specifications;
<span class="rant">{ Because interop between specs is important. Interop betweeen applications? That's for pansies. }</span>
</li>
<li>Establish sufficient confidence in the proposed format, in
particular establishing confidence that the performance gains are
significant, and the potential for disruption to existing processors
is small;
<span class="rant">{ Yeah, small disruption for the processors, 
  unless those processors happen to be human. }</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several approaches to achieve the integration with
XML. The Working Group will provide at least one way for the new
format to be both recognized as XML by existing parsers 
<span class="rant">{ Because we realize that our only chance
at being adopted is to co-opt the name XML. I mean really, we can
count on one hand the number of people on the planet that know ASN.1. 
 }</span> and also
rejected in a meaningful way, <em>such as</em> by defining a new value
for the pseudo–attribute encoding.
<span class="rant">{ I'll give you <i>rejected in a meaningful way</i>. }</span>
</p>
<p>The Working Group will start by considering existing solutions and
will evaluate each in terms of implementability and performance
against the requirements and use cases documents produced by the
XML Binary Characterization Working Group.
<span class="rant">{ We will carefully go through
the motions of pretending to care. }</span>
</p>
<h2 id="out">Out of scope</h2>
<p>This Working Group is not chartered to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce a new data model for XML;
  <span class="rant">{ That was actually considered!?! You mean this could have been even worse?!? }</span>
</li>
<li>Develop an application specific format. Like XML itself, the new format
  must support a <cite>wide variety of applications</cite>. <span class="rant">{ But don't 
  worry about interoperating with any applications currently running on the planet. }</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="success">Success criteria</h2>
<p>Two of the entrance criteria used for the Last Call phase will
be:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Working Group Note on the impact of the new format
      on existing XML technologies;
      <span class="rant">{ Memo to self: Write memo to self acknowledging the irreparable harm we've done 
      to XML and the internet. }</span>
</li>
<li>the Working Group Note analyzing the performance gains of the
  new format, based on the criteria included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbc-measurement/">measurement
  methodologies</a> document. For example, in the case of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/NOTE-xbc-measurement-20050331/#c-method">compactness</a>,
  the information compression is expected to be at most 20% larger
  than its equivalent ASN.1 PER, when a schema optimization is in
  use. Some of the analysis require to have an implementation and will
  be done during the Candidate Recommendation phase, such as
  <em>processing efficiency</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Careful review will be given to the feedback from other Groups,
within and outside the XML Activity. <span class="rant">{ I doubt it. }</span> Findings that suggest that the
proposed format has a significant impact and disruption of existing
XML technologies and processors might dissuade W3C from advancing the
format to W3C Candidate Recommendation, or might persuade W3C to do so
but without referring to the format as a flavor of XML.
<span class="rant">{ It hasn't stopped you so far, why start now? }</span>
</p>
<p>Two of the entrance criteria used for the
Proposed Recommendation phase will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>demonstrate the performance gains of the new format, based on
  the prior analysis done as an entrance criteria of the Last Call
  phase. In addition, an analysis regarding the properties that need an implementation
  to be evaluated, such as <em>processing efficiency</em>, will be conducted.</li>
<li>demonstrate at least two interoperable implementations
  supporting all the features provided in the specification. One of
  the implementations must be available for public use.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Working Group may at any stage recommend the use of an already
published format, provided that it satisfies the above criteria,
instead of providing a W3C Recommendation.
<span class="rant">{ We reserve the right to sell out. }</span>
</p>

<p>
  Now at this point I could enumerate all the
  things that are wrong with Binary XML but I won't bother
  wasting your, or the W3Cs, time. They have heard all the objections
  and ignored them. It's just sad watching them march themselves into irrelevancy.
