title: The Pascal String Challenge

---

  
  <blockquote><p>The AtomAPI is an emerging interface for editing content. The interface is RESTful and uses XML and HTTP to define an editing scheme that's easy to implement and extend. History, basic operation, and applications to areas outside weblogs will be covered.</p></blockquote>
<p>The quote above is my Brief Session Description for my speaking proposal
   I just submitted for <a href="http://www.xmlconference.org/xmlusa/">
   XML Conference &amp; Exposition 2004</a>. It's not very interesting on its own
   except that it is <strong>exactly</strong> 255 characters long. That was the limit
   for the Brief Session Description and I'm proud to say I nailed it precisely.
   I even had a bit of trouble submitting it because the first time I missed a trailing
   space on the description which made it 25<strong>6</strong> characters long. They're not 
   kidding around here. When I mentioned this to <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark</a> 
   in IRC he responded that it would fit perfectly in a Pascal string. </p>
<p>Which of course leads to <strong>The Pascal String Challenge</strong>.
   Write a blog entry that is exactly 255 characters and link back to this post. 
   Markup characters do not count. Titles and permalinks do not count.
