title: httplib2 - 0.4.0

---

  
  <p>Version 0.4.0 of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a> is now available. This release includes bug fixes and support for proxies. The proxy support is only enabled if you have
<a href="http://socksipy.sourceforge.net/">Socksipy</a> installed.
</p>
<p>The big change to current users is that <code>force_exception_to_status_code</code> now defaults to False. It was previously True, but that turned out to
be confusing default behaviour for new users.
