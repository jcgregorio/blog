title: Framework 2.0

<p>
As you can see from the following graph the hype around
Ruby on Rails is beginning to fade:

</p>

  
<p>
What you see in that <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22ruby+on+rails%22%2C+django&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">graph I pulled off Google Trends is a plot
of "Ruby on Rails" in blue verus Django in red</a>. I put in Django just
for reference, the important point is that Rails peaked
somewhere in the middle of 2006 and is now declining.
</p>
<p>
Not only is the 'popularity' of Rails declining we are already 
starting to see the <a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/openmind-2006/">rise of a backlash</a>.
The backlash isn't surprising in the technology arena,
particularly involving something as 'religious' as programming languages.
</p>
<p>
All of that should not diminish Rails, but instead should 
put it in proper persepective. 
The real value in Rails was a singular, opinionated vision
of how web developement should be done. That vision moved the
bar for the whole industry, which is quite an accomplishment.
But there's nothing magical about Ruby, or Rails. 
All of the underlying concepts of Rails can be 'ported' to 
almost any other language, which is exactly what were seeing
today, with Rails-like frameworks appearing in Python, Perl, etc.
Rails success was defining the platonic solid for second generation web 
frameworks. Framework 2.0.
</p>
<p>
Just like I <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Next_Java">don't believe that there will
be a 'next Java'</a> I don't believe there will be a 
'next web framework'. There's
plenty of room for lots of second generation 
web frameworks.
</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
Just so I can save some people the trouble of sending me hate mail:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I know the graph for Django includes all the hits
for the musician. I'm not comparing RoR to Django, I'm just
commenting on the overall curve for Rails.
</li>
<li>Yes, I know <em>your</em> framework was out there earlier
than Rails, and has more features than Rails, and is prettier
than Rails. It just doesn't matter, Rails caught the hype 
and popularized what are now the Framework 2.0 idioms.
Let's just chalk that up to life not being fair and move on.
</li>
<li>I don't <em>hate</em> Rails, nor am I attacking it, I 
am just observing its affect on the industry and its role
in this latest wave of web development. You may not like
how I think RoR will be positioned historically; feel free to 
publish your own predictions and we'll compare them over beers in a 
few years.
</li>
</ol>
