title: Robaccia Pastebin

---

  
  <p>
while some people think a screencast is a good demo, I personally
like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin">pastebin</a>, and besides, that's something I can really use.
This is just a standard Robaccia project with a single model-view named
'bin'. The files that are actually changed are the 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/pastebin/main.cgi/bin/">first four files in the pastebin</a>, just to ensure <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/136/bzr-feed">self-referential integrity</a>.
If you want to run this on our own you'll need to install
<a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a>, the very powerful and well written syntax highlighting library.
</p>
<p>
I have also added the pastebin as a sample project in the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/robaccia/">Robaccia subversion repository</a>.
