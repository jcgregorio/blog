title: A Ringing Endorsement

---

  
  <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/919691.asp?0cv=BA00">Microsoft settles
browser suit with AOL</a>. Actually the title would better read, "Microsoft pays
AOL $750,000,000 to shut down Mozilla". Which is quite an endorsement from
Microsoft if they're willing to pay that much money. I wonder if the 
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/919792.asp">ploy</a> will
actually backfire on Microsoft, the worst case scenario I could see is Mozilla,
after being jettisoned by AOL, is picked up by Apache. While I don't normally
endorse slimey marketing tactics, "The majority of the Web is served up by
Apache Web Servers, shouldn't you be using the Apache Web Browser?", has a nice ring to it.</p>
