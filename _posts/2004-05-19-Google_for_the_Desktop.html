title: Google for the Desktop

  <blockquote><p>What you really want is Google for the desktop. [<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Longhorn_versus_the_light_of_day">Me</a> talking about the viability of WinFS last November]</p></blockquote>
<p>Today we learn that <a href="http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2004/may/19google.htm">Google for the desktop</a>
   may become a reality. </p>
<p>Oh, that sounds so cool. What I'd really like is a search bar
   that I could setup so it knew who I was. That is, I want to be
   able to setup the search bar so that if I do a search it considers
   files on the local file system and all the content at <code>http://bitworking.org</code>
   all to be local/personal information. This in particular would help
   if I could also get it to index intranet info, but that might start
   biting into the <a href="http://www.google.com/appliance/">Google Search Appliance</a>
   sales A guy can dream can't he?
