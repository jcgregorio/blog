     So I downloaded <a href="http://softwaregarden.com/products/wikicalc/index.html">wikiCalc</a>
     and after doing the usual Perl/CPAN/Sacrificial-Chicken Dance I finally got it mostly
     up and running. One of the reasons I wanted to give it a try was to
     see if I could get it to include sparklines via my <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparklines</a>
     web service. I tried using the wikiCalc function <code>wkcHTTP()</code> but all the permutations I try keep failing. I went 
     off in search of the wikiCalc mailing list, or wikiCalc bugzilla, or wikiCalc wiki, or wikiCalc IRC channel; any one of the 
     trappings of a typical open source community.

     I found none of them.
