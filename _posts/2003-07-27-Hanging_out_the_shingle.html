title: Custom System Development

---

  
  <p>I am pleased to announce the formation of my company, <a href="http://bitworking.com">BitWorking, Inc.</a>, a custom system development company able to provide tailored software for Windows Desktop, Embedded and Web Services applications. </p>
<p>The website, newly lauched, is valid XHTML 1.0 and CSS. Would you expect any less?</p>
<p>If you would be so kind as to link to my site with the words <a href="http://bitworking.com">Custom System Development</a>, I would greatly appreciate it. Well, this is, of course, in lieu of contracting us for your next custom application, which would be even more greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>And finally, yes, the site is pages and pages of promotional copy. Promotional copy is hard to write. Just ask <a href="http://oblivio.com/road/03051701.shtml">Michael Barrish</a>. We concur.</p>
