   <p>In my last post I mentioned adding Textile for some “other” project. That “other” project is the new family blog, <a href="http://thegregorios.org">The Gregorios</a> which will be run by my wife Lynne. She’ll be posting a lot more pictures and family stuff than I do around here and giving progress reports on the adoption. The content won’t be nearly as technical as mine unless you get her going on statistics. Please welcome her to the neighborhood.</p>
