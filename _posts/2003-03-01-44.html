title: RSS and Content Negotiation

---

  
  <p><a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/03/01.html#a1047">Simon</a>
has just checked in support for content negotiation
for Aggie. Hopefully well see more tools support this.
<a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/2">RESTLog</a> has always supported
content negotiaion. For example, if you do a GET on the url
<code>http://wellformedweb.org/news</code> in a browser you will
get the HTML version but an RSS aggregator that supports content negotiation
will get the RSS feed from the same URL. Now there are few aggregators that
currently support conneg so RESTLog allows you to add a query parameter to
over-ride the content type. Thus the other way to get the RSS feed is by the
url <code><a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news?rss">http://wellformedweb.org/news?rss</a></code></p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    Is this a good idea? This might be confusing to people, and seems silly to have two URIs to the same document (one with o=rss in the query string and one without).

    I am supporting content-negotiation for the sake of learning and experimentation, though you can see from this entry:

that I don't think it has much of a future. I, for example, will be removing it from the RESTLog API in the near future.
