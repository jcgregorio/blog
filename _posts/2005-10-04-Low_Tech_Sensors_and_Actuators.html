<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://lowtech.propositions.org.uk/lowtech-sensors-and-actuators.pdf">Usman Haque and Adam Somlai-Fischer (pdf)</a>:

environments, in cutting costs and development time we often had to resort to a "low-tech"
approach, rewiring keyboards to get pressure-pad input into computers, or <b>using the monitor with
light sensors and relays to get physical output from computers</b>.
