title:  Screencasts 

---

        <p>I recently got a copy of <a href=http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp>Camtasia</a> and have been producing
        screencasts with it and now two of them are available on 
        <a href=http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers>Google Developer's Channel on YouTube</a>.
        Camtasia is really easy to use and comes with a nice set of
        screencasts that explain how to use it. You would hope that would 
        be true for software for producing screencasts. The autozoom feature
        is nice, but setting up keyframes is so easy I don't really mind when 
        it gets the proportions wrong. It's worked out well enough that Lynne 
        has now bought herself her own copy to produce screencasts for her <a href=http://www.apex-math.com>business</a>.
