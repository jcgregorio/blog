title:  Comment system review 

---

        <p>When I moved to this new blogging system I did so knowing that if I 
        wanted comments I would have to do so 'on-the-glass', using a Javascript 
        based commenting service. Here are my quick reviews of the three systems
        I tried. Note that I may have missed some features of each system, don't attribute
        to malice that which can be adequately explained by not spending enough time
        in the admin interface. Also note that many of my preferences or dislikes
        are aesthetic in nature and your mileage may vary.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Easy to install</li>
                <li>Can use a variety of logins (including Twitter and OpenID, which are the two that matter to me.)</li>
                <li>Can 'like' and 'report' a comment no matter how you are logged in.</li>
            </ul>

            <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding a comment is a POST with a redirect back to the page, but with a query parameter and
                hash tag appended.</li>
                <li>Sorting of comments is done by clunky looking combo-box.</li>
                <li>If you are logged in via Twitter, the default is to mirror your comment to Twitter.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Adding a comment is an XHR operation with no redirects, query parameters, or
                hash tag appended.</li>
                <li>Can use a variety of logins (including Twitter and OpenID, which are the two that matter to me.)</li>
                <li>Sorting of comments is done by simple links.</li>
                <li>If you are logged in via Twitter, the default is not to mirror your comment to Twitter.</li>

            <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Relatively easy to install</li>
                <li>Adding a comment is an XHR operation with no redirects, query parameters, or
                hash tag appended.</li>
                <li>Can use a variety of logins (But it doesn't include Twitter)</li>
                <li>Is much much more than a comment system, so take the cons with a grain of salt.</li>

        <p>Also note that none of the systems allowed you create a custom captcha. 
        I would like the ability to either add in a series of multiple choice questions
        or a simple formatting request like my old comment system as a form of turing test
        for commenters, or more precisely, a shibboleth generator.
