    <p>Posted here because I got hung up on this.
    If you add a link to your profile, but it doesn't show 
    up when <a href=https://sgapi-recrawl.appspot.com/>you try to force a recrawl</a>, 
    you need to make sure the "This is a profile page about me" checkbox
    is checked in your <a href=http://www.google.com/profiles/me>profile</a>.
