title: Piccolo Now Sports LaTeX Support
---
<p><b>Update [June 2017]: Scratch that, after moving the blog over to Jekyll I
    moved over to using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> for
    LaTeX support. And I never did add Julia support, oh well.</b></p>

  <p>
    In the first of two enhancements to piccolo, LaTeX support has been added.
    Just put the LaTeX in a <code>latex-pic</code> element and it will be converted
    to a PNG, with the alt text set to the LaTeX code.
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;latex-pic>E = mc^2&lt;/latex-pic></code></pre>
  <p>Transforms into:</p>

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <latex-pic>E = mc^2</latex-pic>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This is mostly driven by me trying to learn
    Geometric Algebra and wanting to talk about things like:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <latex-pic>e_{23} = e_2 \wedge e_3</latex-pic>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Next up is adding inline Julia.</p>
