title: Public Domain Enhancement Act

---

  
  <p>From <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">Larry Lessig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have launched a <a href="http://www.PetitionOnline.com/eldred/petition.html">petition</a> to build support for the <a href="http://eldred.cc">Public Domain Enhancement Act</a>.
That act would require American copyright holders to pay $1 fifty years
after a work was published. If they pay the $1, the copyright
continues. If they don't, the work passes into the public domain.
Historical estimates would suggest 98% of works would pass into the
pubilc domain after 50 years. The Act would do a great deal to reclaim
a public domain.</p>
<p>This proposal has received a great deal of support. It is now facing
some important lobbyists'  opposition. We need a public way to begin to
demonstrate who the lobbyists don't speak for. This is the first step. </p>
<p>If you are an ally in at least this cause, please sign the petition.
Please blog it, please email it, please spam it, please buy billboards
about it -- please do whatever you can. And most importantly, please
help us explain its importance. There is a chance to do something
significant here. But it will take a clearer, simpler voice than mine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now go and sign that petition.</p>
