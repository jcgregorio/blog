title: Titles Matter for PyBlosxom

---

  <p>PyBlosxom has a flexible callback mechanism that allows
   pretty fine grained mamipulation of your entries as 
   they are being rendered unto HTML or RSS or whatever you 
   want your output to be. That's real useful since the templating
   engine, while fast, does not allow any calculated 
   values. This is no <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>. Luckily 
   defining callbacks to calculate specific values is simple.</p>
  
<p>One of the finer points of publishing on the web is 
   that <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/03/03.html">titles matter</a>.
   Putting the name of my site, the date, and the title of the 
   article all in the html title of a page is what I currently
   do in Bulu and something I want to duplicate as I migrate
   to PyBlosxom.</p>
<p>This is just a matter of creating a plugin that hooks
   the cb_prepare callback. This callback is activated right before
   rendering takes place. The implementation is simple, it checks
   if the page about to be rendered has only a single entry.
   If it does then is sets the value of data['single_entry_title'].
   Through the magic of the templating system the value of 
   that will be avaiable through $single_entry_title in a 
   template. In the case that there is more than one entry than
   $single_entry_title will evaluate to an empty string.</p>
