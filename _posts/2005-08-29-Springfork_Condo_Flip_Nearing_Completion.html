title: Springfork Condo Flip Nearing Completion

---

  <p>We are close to putting this property back in <abbr title="Multiple Listing Service">MLS</abbr> as we near the end 
   of our remodel. This is our first real flip and as such we learned a lot in the process.
   You always expect to learn something when you do a project this large, but 
   one of the things we didn't expect was how attached we would get to this 
   property. It really <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Springfork_Flip">started out in rough shape</a> and now it's looking great.
   We really are going to miss having a place on the lake.
</p>
  
<p>Just as a reminder, this is what we started with:</p>
<p><img class="framed" alt="This is where we started." src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/passthrough_before.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you might expect, renovating the kitchen was the most time consuming, and most 
   expensive part of the whole remodel. What you can't see from these photos are
   the tile floor and new dishwasher in the kitchen. One of the best decisions we made
   in the whole project was the tile counter and tile floor. As you can see from
   the pictures the countertop is fairly complicated and definitely not a 'standard'
   size. Using tiles allowed us to handle the custom shape easily. It also adds a great
   deal of warmth to the kitchen and was fairly inexpensive. In total it came 
   to about $5 per square foot, where there was significant sweat equity on my part.
   I ripped out the old counter and built up the plywood foundation for the new counter.

<p><img class="framed" alt="This is how it looks today with refaced maple cabinets" src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/new-cabinets.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another big expense in a kitchen remodel is the cabinets. New cabinets would have swamped our 
   budget so we went with refacing, that is, replacing only the doors of the cabinets
   and keeping the cabinet carcasses. We painted them white to hide the oak, and 
   put on new maple doors and drawer faces. These are custom order items, each door and 
   drawer face built to order, so if you plan on doing this yourself leave enough time 
   for the order to arrive. These arrived 5 weeks after we placed the order.

<p><img class="framed" alt="Here is another shot of the kitchen." src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/kitchen-breakfast-bar.jpg" /></p>
<p>One of the best decisions we made was adding the structural details like the columns
   and light box around the breakfast bar. Those are just 2x4's and sheet rock
   and the total material cost including the lights probably came to less than
   $300. One of the reasons it was so cheap is that none of the changes we made were
   structural. The other reason is that 2x4's and sheetrock are cheap.
   Oh, and from this day forward, the phrase 'like a hot knife through butter' will
   be solely reserved to describe a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26keyword=sawzall%26index=tools">sawsall</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

<p><img class="framed" alt="Bamboo hardwood floors in the living room, dining room and hallway" src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/hardwoods-dining-room-hall.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another decision we are happy with, but would probably scale back in our 
   next flip, is the bamboo hardwood flooring. It's relatively inexpensive
   to buy, around $2 per square foot, but the expenses start adding up if  you have to 
   put down a subfloor over concrete like we did here. There is also the time it 
   takes to install, or the cost, depending on if you are doing the installation yourself
   or paying someone to do the install for you.
</p>
<p><img class="framed" alt="The bedrooms got a fresh coat of paint and berber carpet." src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/bedroom-paint-carpet.jpg" /></p>
<p>The bedrooms got new Berber carpet and a fresh coat of paint. In addition there
is a new closet organizer in the master bedroom walk-in closet and all the 
light fixtures are new. The one big regret on this project is the master bath
shower fixture. It's all brand new, we replaced the aging one 
that was there with a much better design. In reality it probably 
would have looked just as nice if we had replaced the visible
components with exact replacement parts. Instead we picked a whole
new system which required me to open up the wall behind the bathroom
and replace a good deal of the plumbing in the wall. The whole 
set of plumbing is now in much better shape than it was before, but
all the hard work is covered over in sheet rock and completely 
invisble to any buyer. And besides, have I ever mentioned that I 
dislike plumbing with great intensity?
