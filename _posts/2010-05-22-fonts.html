title:  Google Font API 

---

    <p>One of the many cool things launched at 
    Google IO was the <a href=http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/>Google Font API</a>.
    I'm now using that and a quick refresh should get you all the content
    here in a combination of Cantarell and Inconsolata.</p>
    <p>
    I like that fact that typographically my site will render
    more and more consistently over time.
    </p>
    <p>
    I <b>love</b> the fact that Google just released 18* open fonts.
    </p>
    <p class="note">* Actually three of the fonts were not just released; the Droid Fonts have been out for a while.</p>
