title: Welcome John Panzer

---

  
  <p>John Panzer is a technical manager for web based products at AOL, is active one the atom-syntax mailing 
  list, and now has a blog.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://journals.aol.com/panzerjohn/abstractioneer/entries/445">John Panzer</a>:  The immediate purpose of this blog is to publish thoughts about web technologies, particularly Atom.  Of course that suffers from the recursive blogging-about-blogging syndrome, so I'll probably expand it to talk about software in general.</p></blockquote>
