title: High-Speed Rail

---

  
  <p>
I'm thrilled with all the of the initiatives that
the Obama administration has put forward, but the
<a href="http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/31">Vision of High-Speed Rail in America</a>
is the one that's near and dear to my
heart. I think it would be fantastic to be able to step
on a train and be one stop from Charlotte and two
stops from Washington, DC, three to PA, and four to NY.
I also believe that the North Carolina area has a good plan
in place that was very close to being funded and it looks
like that could also move forward out of this plan.
The amount of time I've been spending on planes and
in airports lately just drives the need home for this even more.

    I'm travelling from Berlin to Rotterdam once a month. I have the option to take a plane to Amsterdam, and then continue from there, but there is a close-to-direct connection by train, taking about 1-2 hours longer.

Taking a train is just so much better than flying, I'd pick the train at any time, even if it takes a bit longer.
