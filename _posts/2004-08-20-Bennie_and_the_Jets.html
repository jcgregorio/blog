title: Bennie and the Jets

---

  <p>There is some music I just don't like. For example pop music
    from the 70's, or say, anything from Elton John. I would just
    prefer not to listen to it. Not that I claim
    it's painful to listen to, unlike show tunes. It's not even
    that show tunes are painful, but it just seems there's always
    at least one person around who was in theater in high school
    that insists
    on singing along. Even when no one is around, there's that
    lingering dread that some theatre person is going to jump
    out from behind a shrub and join in "I am the very model of a modern Major-General".</p>

  <h3>She's got electric boots</h3>
<p>So we have established that I do not like 70's music.
    Which made it very disturbing to find myself
    humming a 70's tune every morning
    while taking a shower. Every morning. A different 70's tune.
    Is this some sort of perverse cosmic punishment that
    I be selected to channel a 1970's DJ?</p>
<h3>A mohair suit</h3>
<p>My AM/FM/CD alarm clock was designed by a sadist.
   This is actually ok, since I believe waking up
   should be a pain causing event, so much so that I actually
   try to add to the pain. For example, I set the clock
   20 minutes ahead, that way when the alarm goes off,
   I have to do math. I also set the alarm to wake
   me with an annoying buzzing sound. I could choose
   to be woken with music, but the buzzing, that's where the
   pain is at.</p>
<p>The clock, being designed by a sadist, goes to
     great lengths to make it difficult to turn the
     alarm on an off. The mechanism is a small slider
     the moves between 4 positions. The positions are clearly
     labelled, but that's just to taunt you, because the slider
     is located on the side of the clock, where you can't see
     the labels.</p>

<p>Also note that the two most useful settings are
     located in the middle, where it is hardest to set
     the slider. The end points, on and off, are at the
     ends and are easiest to use, as if the primary funtion of
     this device were for music. Let's be realistic, I
     haven't used my alarm clock
     as my primary stereo system since college.
 </p>
<h3>You know I read it in a magaziiiiine</h3>
<p>I was baffled by my ability to channel a 1970's DJ
   until one day my finger slipped while trying to turn
   off the alarm and it landed on the "Music" alarm setting and found that
   the radio was tuned to a 70's Hits station. </p>
<p>This was a clue.</p>
<p>I reset the alarm for minute later and waited.</p>
<p>When it went off I slid the control from Buzz to Off
    but more slowly than normal.</p>
<p>There it was. Just a snippet of the radio broadcast
    trailing out behind the alarm buzzer before going
    silent.</p>
<p>I did it again.</p>
<p>I would have probably experimented more had my wife
    not glared out from underneath the covers next to me,
    "What the hell are you doing?"</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, "I....". I looked into those
    kind, loving eyes and realized that sharing my excitement
    over my discovery would not go over well. Instead, I opted for the quick exit, "Nothing dear."
    I padded off into the bathroom.
</p>
<h3>Bennie and the Jets</h3>
<p>So now I had my answer; sliding
   from Buzz to Off always let a small snippet of the
   radio slip out, not enough for me to notice consciously
   but just enough, maybe a half a second or less of music, that my unconscious
   could figure it out by the time I got in the shower.
</p>
<p>This was terribly upsetting. Although I had solved the
    mystery, it had a far darker implication. In my head, in some
    dark recess, I am carrying around an entire library of 1970's pop music.
