title: Proposed change to the CommentAPI

---

  
   <p>Because of this <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1453.html#c1055176165">discussion</a> on Sam Ruby’s blog I have updated the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9#SummaryTable">CommentAPI</a> with the proposed changes. All the changes are in the table, with the new stuff in yellow, and deleted stuff crossed through. This is currently a <strong>proposed</strong> change. Scream now or forever hold your peace.</p>

     <p>Have to be honest, I don’t really like it. Adding one namespaced element means I have to recode to allow the dc:author element and also change how the <span class="caps">XML</span> is stored for a fairly minor gain.<br />
I’d thought the standard for author was:<br />
name (e-mail) which leaves title free anyway – maybe I was wrong but it does seem to work OK.</p>

     <p>Joe, is this change going ahead?<br />
I’ve been looking into supporting it but just won’t be able to unless the <span class="caps">XML</span> fragments come in with namespace declarations for Dublin Core. If they do, by default then I can handle it but if not the <span class="caps">MSXML</span> parser chokes before I can even get to the content. i.e. my ability to support this change in BlogWorks depends on how the spec asks apps to send the fragments to compliant ‘receivers‘.<br />
Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>

  The proper DC namespace would be required to be declared. I'm not proposing anything that would break an XML parser, or violate the XML namespace spec. </p>
<p>For an example, see:</p>

<p>Though I have been reading the Dublin Core specifications and I believe that using dc:creator this way, with the name <b>and</b> the URI, is wrong.</p>
