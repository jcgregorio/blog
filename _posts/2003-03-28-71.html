  <p>First, I haven't been posting much because my day job has been
   keeping me busy. How busy? Well a normal week might include
   one special project/product. This week saw 5. Enough said.
</p>
<p>But, I come out of this crunch to two nice discoveries.
   First, <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/1261.html">as promised</a>, Sam Ruby has <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1294.html">implemented</a> the 
   <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">Comment API</a>.
</p>
<p>Secondly, but no less important, <a href="http://pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/03/1141.html">Simon Fell</a> has implemented both
   the client and server-side of the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/5">RESTLog</a> 
   interface for his weblog.
</p>

    BlogWorks XML now has a CommentAPI implementation. 
Currently it's only working at my site - www.xasperate.com - because it's part of the development version but it'll be going live in v1.2 fairly soon.
