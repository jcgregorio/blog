Indeed, my current implementation just shows the validated Webmention
links, and my plan is to slowly enhance them over time. I think, just like
in the [case of the basic Webmention support](https://willnorris.com/go/webmention), [Will
Norris](https://willnorris.com) may have my back again and have already done
the heavy lifting for [Microformats and Go](https://willnorris.com/go/microformats).
