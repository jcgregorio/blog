title: Having fun with silo metadata.
---
I just recently finished adding support for
[Twitter metadata](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary)
to the blog, mostly motivaged by [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/)'s ability to use
Webmentions to automatically post my blog entries to Twitter. As I worked on
the Twitter metadata I wondered if other silos had their own metadata they
supported. Indeed they do, and Kevin Marks brilliantly demonstrates how
ridiculous the situation is by creating a
[blog post that appears different in every silo]( http://www.kevinmarks.com/partialsilos.html).
