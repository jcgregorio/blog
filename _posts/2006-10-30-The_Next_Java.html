title: The 'Next' Java

---

  
  
<p>
I recently read Bruce Tate's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beyondjava/">Beyond Java</a> in which he explores
the idea of which language will rise supreme after Java. He
ends up talking a lot about languages like Ruby and Python,
and while that's nice to hear someone give these languages
their due, I'm left wondering if the question is even valid.
That is to say, I'm wondering if the core idea that there was one
language which 'won', and the obvious implication that all the other languages 'lost',
is true. If it's not true then the whole question of
Java 'losing' at some point in the future and
some other language 'winning' is just silly.
</p>
<p>
I think the real world is a lot more complex, and richer, than that.
For example, here are the languages I used to generate
my <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/cascon06/127.html">slides for CASCON</a>: Python, HTML, and CSS. Most projects 
I build with <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/robaccia/">Robaccia</a> include all those languages
plus SQL and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Look at <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">TIOBE</a>, which really only measures hype around
a language. It doesn't measure lines of code written in that language, 
programmer hours, or the value of all the products built with 
that language. The point is that there are lots of 
metrics by which you can judge a language and 
TIOBE only tracks popularity, and even then Java barely
cracks the 25% mark over the past five years. 
(We'll leave the great TIOBE "adjustment" of 2004 for
a later discussion.) 
</p>
<p>
We don't live in a monolithic
world, we never have, and we never will. 
My prediction isn't that Ruby or Python will be
the next 'winner'. My prediction is that we'll see
the same thing tomorrow as we see today: a frothing 
stew of languages competing for niches on an 
ever growing software landscape.
