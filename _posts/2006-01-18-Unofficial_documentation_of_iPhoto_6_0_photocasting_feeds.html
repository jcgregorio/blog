title: Unofficial documentation of iPhoto 6.0 photocasting feeds

---

  
  <blockquote> <p>
<a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/syndication-dev/2006/Jan/msg00020.html">Mark Pilgrim</a>: To sum up, the "photocasting" feature centers around a single
undocumented extension element in a namespace that doesn't need to be
declared.  iPhoto 6 doesn't understand the first thing about HTTP, the
first thing about XML, or the first thing about RSS.  It ignores
features of HTTP that Netscape 4 supported in 1996, and mis-implements
features of XML that Microsoft got right in 1997.  It ignores 95% of
RSS and Atom and gets most of the remaining 5% wrong.
