With Russian bots on Twitter,
[the attack on Rotten Tomatoes scores](https://qz.com/1160551/the-rotten-tomatoes-score-for-the-last-jedi-may-be-rigged/),

[and even attacks on a DARPA Network Challenge](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/how-a-lone-hacker-shredded-the-myth-of-crowdsourcing/), I think 2018
is the beginning of the end for crowdsourcing, at least until identity on the web is solved.
