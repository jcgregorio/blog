title: The Spreadsheet as Mashup Fabric

---

  
  
<p>
I recently <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Olduvai_Imperative">pointed</a> 
to a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/10/30.html">cool thing Jon Udell did with my sparklines generator</a>. 
In that article Jon asks:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    How can more people be empowered to do such redesigns, for print and for the web?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
My answer is based on my 
opinion that any solution needs to be <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Document_Centric">
Document Centric</a>. I believe an online spreadsheet is an excellent 
starting point for building a mashup fabric: a document into which
a range of online services can be combined.
To that end I downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.wikicalc.org/">wikiCalc</a>
and tried to integrate my <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparklines service</a>
into a spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
Now <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a>  has done a huge amount of work, 
and the wikiCalc <code>wkcHTTP()</code> function is almost exactly what I needed to start. 
Almost, but not quite. The default behavior of wkcHTTP() when given:
</p>
<pre><code>=wkcHTTP("http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/wikispark.cgi", 10, "error", "GET", A1:A9)
</code></pre>
<p>generates a URI that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/wikispark.cgi?V1=N10,V2=N20,V3=N23,V4=N40,v5=N70,V6=N80,V7=12,V8=N87
</code></pre>
<p>
Note what <code>wkcHTTP()</code> is doing to the args, the range <tt>A1:A9</tt> is broken out so that the
value of each cell is a separate query parameter. What I would need to make this work for the 
sparkline generator is that <tt>A1:A9</tt> gets lumped into one query parameter, and I 
get to choose that query parameter's name. In other words I'd like to 
be able to call:
</p>
<pre><code>=wkcHTTP("http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/wikispark.cgi", 10, "error", "GET", <b>"d"</b>, A1:A9)
</code></pre>
<p>
and have it generate a URI of the form:
</p>
<pre><code>http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/wikispark.cgi?d=1,10,20,23,40,70,80,12,87
</code></pre>
<p>
Where I come from code speaks louder than words, so here is the patch to wikiCalc 0.95:

And here is the output of a sample spreadsheet successfully including a sparkline
with the values driven off the sheet itself:

<h3>Observations</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Quality</dt>
<dd>This is just a kludge to show my ideas, a real patch
   would handle multiple parameters, error checking, etc.
   My Perl skills are currently way too rusty to do it justice.
</dd>
<dt>Typing</dt>
<dd>In order for this to <b>really</b> work
 I had to write a special version
of the sparkline web service, <code>wikispark.cgi</code>, 
that created a snippet of HTML to wrap the sparkline image,
since wikiCalc can't natively import an image. That's not 
too bad, but I also had to prepended that HMTL snippet
with a single <tt>H</tt> character as it appears  that
wikiCalc requires the result of the HTTP response body
to begin with a single character which it uses to determine
its type and how to handle it. Those of you who know 
me can well imagine my <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=apoplectic">apopleptic</a> 
fit. I am willing to over look
that for now, but if wikiCalc is to become
the mashup fabric that I believe it can be, then it should become a little more
aware of it's 'context' and start using the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17">content-type</a> of the response to determine the right 
representation.
