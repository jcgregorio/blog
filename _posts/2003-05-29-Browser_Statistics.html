<p>YMMV.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Well, there's lies, damn lies, and statistics.
  Based on feedback from <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Browser_Statistics#X1">Fabrice</a>
  I went back and filtered the last six days of logs and took only hits
  that accessed the root of BitWorking, and then manually stripped out
  all the robots, spiders, scrapers, aggregators and other non-desktop browser agents. 
  Wow, was I suprised at the wild and woolly internet agent ecology that's sprouted up.
  What I ended up with after all the filtering now looks like:</p>
<strong>Updated again on 30May2003, I mis-counted some agents.</strong>

<p>Note that in the above I didn't filter based on incoming IP address. Back to the drawing board.</p>

    IE could even be considered at a lower percentage (for weblogs) because a lot of RSS clients are using it to display web pages, which doesn't mean that the users are using IE as their default browser.

    Good point. Maybe I'll dig through the logs and remove the hits to the RSS feeds.
