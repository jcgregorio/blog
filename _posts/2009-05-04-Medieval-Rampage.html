title: Medieval Rampage

    Medieval Rampage</a> is Christopher's latest game, and has 
garnered more than 250,000 plays in its first 48 hours.
It's nice to see the incredible amount of work he's put into it pay off.
</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Christopher has decided to upgrade from CS3 to CS4, but 
Adobe has changed the program and now
being in high school no longer qualifies him for an educational discount.
That little change may end up costing him an extra $500 to upgrade.

    It's a neat little game. I get a sore wrist on my trackpad pretty quickly, though. ;)
