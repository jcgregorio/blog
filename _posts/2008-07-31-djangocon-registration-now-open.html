    But they're being really annoying and only releasing 100 tickets at a time.  If I was able to attend, I'd be very turned off by the whole deal because of that.

    Scott: that's because we only have 200 available, and we want to give folks in different time zones a chance without having to be up at all hours of the night. It sucks that we couldn't have a bigger venue, but the fact is that planing anything much larger than a few hundred takes at least a *year*, and we didn't want to wait that long.

The good news is that all the talks will be recorded and released online, so even if you can't go you won't miss anything except the smell. Which, trust me, isn't all that awesome.

    Wow, I had no idea it was that small of a venue.  Good luck with the conference.  :)
