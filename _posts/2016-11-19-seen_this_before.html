title: Surely we&#39;ve seen this before. Not.

  <p>You might think that as the U.S. moves from an industrial and
    manufacturing based economy to a knowledge based economy that we surely
    have weathered similar tranistions. For example, as we moved from an
    agricultural economy to a manufacturing based one. While we did indeed
    weather the same changes, the vital difference is the timescale over which
    those changes took place.

  <p>As you can see from this data on
    <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-employment/">agricultural
      employment</a>, we did experience a loss of 6 million agricultural jobs
    over a 50 year period from 1910 to 1960. In contrast, from <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/03/15/voter-anger-explained-in-one-chart/">Voter
      anger explained—in one chart</a>, you can see that the U.S. economy
    also lost 6 million manufacturing jobs, but this time in just 10 years, from 2000 to 2010.
