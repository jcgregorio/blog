title: SocialText launches an appliance

---

  
  <p>Well, to be precise, SocialText launched an
appliance a little while back, now they 
have a <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/saas_appliance.html">Managed Service Appliance</a>.
So a customer can buy a wiki in a box, have that
data behind their firewall, but still outsource the maintenance
of that box back to SocialText.
</p>
<p>Think of all those <i>other</i> services out there that
 enterprises would never use because they don't want
 to lose control of their data, this seems like an interesting 
 approach.
