title: RSS to (not)Echo

---

  
   <p>Want an idea of what your <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed would look like as Echo? <a href="http://www.tnl.net/blog/entry/RSS2Necho">Tristan Louis has a converter</a> to do just that. Here is <a href="http://www.tnl.net/channels/rss2necho/http://bitworking.org/index.rss">BitWorkings feed as (not)-Echo</a>, which by the way, <a href="http://www.tnl.net/channels/rss2necho/http://bitworking.org/index.rss">validates</a> using the <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/news/archives/2003/07/09/preliminary_pie_support.html">recently updated Feed validator</a>.</p>

    Joe, is the content element correct in that feed ?, it appears to be double encoded, in that its both entity encoded and wrapped in a CDATA section.

    Yes, you're right, it is double-encoded.
