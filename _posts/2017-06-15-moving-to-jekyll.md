title: Moving to Jekyll
---

I am in the process of moving this blog over to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), while at the same time admitting that I'm
never going to finish writing my own blogging software, and that I really
should concentrate on the writing, and not the underlying software.

This is also an admission that for a while there may be general brokenness
such as broken links and some horribly formatted posts.

Also, I will be turning on comments, which is a longer post in itself, but
let's just say that after years of watching abuse and generally uncivil
behavior on all the social networks I've decided to revert to old technology
from a simpler time, where I get to have absolute control over what appears
next to my writing. Call me old fashioned.

*Update*: And comments are now enabled, the [Jekyll Minima
theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
made that way too easy.
