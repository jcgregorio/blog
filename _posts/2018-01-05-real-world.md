[RealWorld example apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) is
a great idea:

>  See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is built using any
>  of our supported frontends and backends. Yes, you can mix and match them,
>  because they all adhere to the same API spec

And it looks like porting the app over to Vanilla JS
[is already underway](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/111).
