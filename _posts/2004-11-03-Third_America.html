title: Third America

---

  
  <blockquote><p><a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010986.shtml">Dan Gilmore:</a> I suspect there's a third America: members of an increasingly radical middle that will 
become more obvious in the next few years, tolerant of those who are different 
and aware that the big problems of our times are being ignored -- or made worse -- 
by those in power today.</p>
<p>That third America needs a candidate. Or, maybe, a new party.</p></blockquote>
