title: Welcome back to incremental innovation. The lull of six years ofmonopoly-induced stagnation is over.

  <p>The new &lt;canvas/&gt; element, being standardized by the WhatWG, was just turned on in Mozilla.</p>

We are turning canvas on -- it's already on by now. Get over it.
Nothing in a relatively new spec is set in concrete, but that does not
prevent useful work from being built on it. This is how the Internet
protocols, and then the web, were built. Welcome back to incremental
innovation. The lull of six years of monopoly-induced stagnation is
over. [<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288714#c50">Brendan Eich</a>] </p></blockquote>

<p>Do you have any idea how big this is? It is totally huge. Not the 
   element itself, but the fact that developers are finally getting over
   playing follow-the-leader to Microsoft and the W3C and 
   getting on with the job of innovating. I'm looking forward to a new age 
   of incremental innovation.</p>
