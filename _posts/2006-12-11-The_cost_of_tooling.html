title: The cost of tooling

<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.unto.net/programming/two-weekend-days/">DeWitt Clinton</a>:
  I just wasted the second of two weekend days spending more time setting up development 
  tools and programming environments than I did accomplishing what I set out to do in the first place.
  </p>
<p>
  Specifically, I once again wrestled Eclipse and WTP and Maven and Junit and Subclipse
  and Hibernate and Spring [and, and, and...] into partial submission.

<p>In other industries I've worked in 'tooling' is a separate 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_accounting">cost</a> tracked for
   each product.
