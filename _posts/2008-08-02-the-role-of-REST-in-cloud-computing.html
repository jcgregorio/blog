title: The role of REST in Cloud Computing

---

  
  <p>Tim has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/07/open-source-and-cloud-computing.html">a nice article that begins to frame the discussion 
around Cloud Computing</a>. I am not going to address the whole article, but only 
one aspect of it. Here are two quotations from
that article that I want to focus on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So here's my first piece of advice: if you care about open source for the cloud, build on services that are designed to be federated rather than centralized. 
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
A key test of whether an API is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the API provider,
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is an example AtomPub Service Document
  that combines two collections from two imaginary 
  services into a single service. For the sake of the 
  argument let's presume <code>some-blog-service.org</code>
  only hosts blog posts but not media. And let's further
  presume that <code>pictures-r-us.org</code> is a site
  only interested in hosting your pictures and not your 
  blog text. I could handwrite the following
  AtomPub Service Document and host it somewhere and 
  I should now be able to point a generic AtomPub blogging
  client at said Service Document and have access to 
  a service that handles both blog text and images with
  no apriori coordination needed between the two services.
</p>
<pre><code>
   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
   &lt;service xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
            xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
     &lt;workspace&gt;
       &lt;atom:title&gt;My Blog&lt;/atom:title&gt;
       &lt;collection
           <b>href="http://some-blog-service.org/joe" &gt;</b>
         &lt;atom:title&gt;My Blog Entries&lt;/atom:title&gt;
       &lt;/collection&gt;
       &lt;collection
           <b>href="http://pictures-r-us.example.com/atompub/joe" &gt;</b>
         &lt;atom:title&gt;Pictures&lt;/atom:title&gt;
         &lt;accept&gt;image/png&lt;/accept&gt;
         &lt;accept&gt;image/jpeg&lt;/accept&gt;
         &lt;accept&gt;image/gif&lt;/accept&gt;
       &lt;/collection&gt;
     &lt;/workspace&gt;
   &lt;/service&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I am in no way saying that AtomPub is the solution. What I am pointing 
out is that if you want federation then you need to design your
protocols and APIs RESTfully. In this example it is 
hypertext, link following, in the AtomPub spec that allows these
two separate services to be linked together.
