title: That would be so much better in SVG

---

  <p>Just got back from a quick trip to Boston, where I ended up renting a car and driving
to my destination.</p>
<p>Just to make that clear:</p>
<p>I. Drove. In. Boston.</p>
<p>That's one of those things that would be so much better in SVG.</p>

    I'm from the UK. Some former colleagues of mine went to Boston for meetings. They brought back a map and commented how the locals thought navigating was really hard whereas they didn't find it so. Those of us who are used to towns that grew in the Middle Ages think you colonials are spoiled with your grid pattern towns!
