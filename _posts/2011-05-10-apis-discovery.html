title:  APIs Discovery 

---

    <p>The <a href=http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/>APIs Discovery Service</a> launched today. This has been
    in the works for a while, but probably not a secret if you've been
    following <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/source/list>checkins
      to the google-api-python-client library</a>. The announcement went out on the 
    <a href=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/google-apis-discovery-service-one-api.html>Google
      Code blog</a>, and has been covered in other <a href=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/227477/google_launches_discovery_service_for_its_apis.html>venues</a>.
    </p><p>
    Two things to add that haven't been covered so far, the first is that if someone
    besides Google were to build an API that could be described by the Discovery format, then
    <a href=https://code.google.com/apis/discovery/libraries.html>potentially some of these libraries</a> would
    work with that API. Secondly, <a href=https://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html>check out
    that patent license</a>.
    While <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL>the obvious
      questions will be raised</a>, instead let's fill the comments with <b>your</b> theories
    of why we <b>didn't</b> use WADL.
