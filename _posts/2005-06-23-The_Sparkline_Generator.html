title: The Sparkline Generator

---

  
  <p>My latest article, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/06/22/sparklines.html">A Bright, Shiny Service: Sparklines</a>, is now available on XML.com. It's about the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">BitWorking Sparkline Generator</a>, which is a web service, a web application, and source code, all for generating sparklines.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> First public sighting of the sparklines service being used: <a href="http://whereleftisright.blogspot.com/2005/06/saturday-technerd-blogging.html"> Where Left Is Right</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Update 2:</b> First port of the web service, this one being to .NET, by <a href="http://ewbi.blogs.com/develops/2005/07/sparklines.html">Eric Bachtal</a>.

    <p>Man, this just kills me! Swear to god, I've been playing with the same thing -- I wanted a Sparkline generator myself, and I realized how easy it would be to make it a web service (and how great it would be to help popularize Sparklines). I started goofing around with the PHP code a month ago.</p>
<p>I fully admit I'm a mediocre coder, though (barely past hobbyist), and I wouldn't have come up with anything a fraction as polished. Very, very cool, there. I really had wondered whether someone else -- maybe someone with the chops to make this a weekend project -- would get there first. Kudos and a bow.</p>

    From the code, I can't tell why we are limited to an upper bound of 100, or why we can't use floating-point numbers. Could you please expand on that?

    <p>Dan: You have no idea how much I was sweating the fact that someone might beat me to the punch before my XML.com article was published :)</p>
<p>didier:  No particular reason, it seemed the simplest thing that could possibly work. Patches are always welcome!</p>

    Excellent article. If you get a chance, though, you might want to correct the block comment on plot_sparkline() to agree with the implementation.
