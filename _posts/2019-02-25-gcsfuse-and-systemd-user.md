title: gcsfuse and systemd --user
---

Google Cloud Storage has an officially supported [fuse client](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse)!

This is something I have always wanted and would have expected for Google
Drive, but ðŸ¤·.

The only thing better than a fuse client is a fuse directory that gets
mounted automatically when you log in, which you can do fairly simply
using `systemd --user`, which is just systemd, but everthing runs as you.

Here's a gist of how I set this up on my machine:
