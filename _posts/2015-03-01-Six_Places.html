  <p><b>Note:</b> This post was updated in Jan 2017 to use the <a

    V1 spec</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the questions that comes up regularly when talking about <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto">zero frameworks</a>
    is how can you expect to stitch together an application without a framework? The
    short answer is &#34;the same way you stitch together native elements,&#34; but I think
    it&#39;s interesting and instructional to look at those ways of stitching elements
    together individually.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are six surfaces, or points of contact, between elements, that you can
    use when stitching elements together, whether they are native or custom
    elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we go further a couple notes on terminology and scope. For
    scope, realize that we are only talking about DOM, we aren&#39;t talking about
    composing JS modules or strategies for composing CSS. For the terminology
    clarification, when talking about DOM I&#39;m referring to the DOM
    Interface for an element, not the element markup.  Note that there is a
    subtle difference between the markup element and the DOM Interface to such
    an element.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, <code>&lt;img data-foo="5"
      src="https://example.com/image.png"/></code> may be
    the markup for an image. The corresponding DOM Interface has an attribute of
    src with a value of &#34;https://example.com/image.png&#34;, but the corresponding DOM
    Interface doesn&#39;t have a &#34;data-foo&#34; attribute, instead all data-* attributes
    are available via the dataset attribute on the DOM Interface. In the
    terminology of the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#terminology">WhatWG
      Living Standard</a>, this is the distinction between content attributes vs IDL
    attributes, and I&#39;ll only be referring to IDL attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the preliminaries out of the way let&#39;s get into the six surfaces
    that can be used to stitch together an application.
  </p>

  <h2>Attributes and Methods</h2>
  <p>
    The first two surfaces, and probably the most obvious, are attributes and
    methods. If you are interacting with an element it&#39;s usually either reading and
    writing attribute values:
  </p>

  <pre><code>element.children</code></pre>

  <p>
      or calling element methods:
  </p>

  <pre><code>document.querySelector(&#39;#foo&#39;);</code></pre>

  <p>
    Technically these are the same thing, as they are both just properties with
    different types. Native elements have their set of defined attributes and
    methods, and depending on which element a custom element is derived from it
    will also have that base element&#39;s attributes and methods along with the custom
    ones it defines.
  </p>

  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>
    The next two surface are events. Events are actually two surfaces because an
    element can listen for events,
  </p>

  <pre><code>ele.addEventListener(‘some-event’, function(e) { /* */ });</code></pre>

  <p>
    and an element can dispatch its own events:
  </p>

  <pre><code>var e = new CustomEvent(‘some-event’, {details: details});
this.dispatchEvent(e);</code></pre>

  <h2>DOM Position</h2>

  <p>
    The final two surfaces are position in the DOM tree, and again I&#39;m
    counting this as two surfaces because each element has a parent and can be
    a parent to another element. Yeah, an element has siblings too, but that
    would bring the total count of surfaces to seven and ruin my nice round
    even six.
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;button&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

  <h2>Combinations are powerful</h2>
  <p>
    Let&#39;s look at a relatively simple but powerful example, the &#39;sort-stuff&#39;
    element. This is a custom element that allows the user to sort elements. All
    children of &#39;sort-stuff&#39; with an attribute of &#39;data-key&#39; are used for sorting
    the children of the element pointed to by the sort-stuff&#39;s &#39;target&#39; attribute.
    See below for an example usage:
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;sort-stuff target=&#34;#sortable&#34;&gt;
   &lt;button data-key=one&gt;Sort on One&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;button data-key=two&gt;Sort on Two&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/sort-stuff&gt;
 &lt;ul id=sortable&gt;
   &lt;li data-one=c data-two=x&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-one=a data-two=z&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-one=d data-two=w&gt;Item 4&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-one=b data-two=y&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-one=e data-two=v&gt;Item 5&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    If the user presses the &#34;Sort on One&#34; button then the children of #sortable
    are sorted in alphabetical order of their data-one attributes. If the user
    presses the &#34;Sort on Two&#34; button then the children of #sortable are sorted in
    alphabetical order of their data-two attributes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is the definition of the &#39;sort-stuff&#39; element:
  </p>

  <pre><code id=viewcode>
  </code></pre>


  <p>
    And here is a running example of the code above:
  </p>

  <style type="text/css" media="screen">
    sort-stuff button {
      padding: 0.5em;
    }
  </style>

  <sort-stuff target="sortable">
    <button data-key="one">Sort on One</button>
    <button data-key="two">Sort on Two</button>
  </sort-stuff>
  <ul id="sortable">
    <li data-one="c" data-two="x">Item 3</li>
    <li data-one="a" data-two="z">Item 1</li>
    <li data-one="d" data-two="w">Item 4</li>
    <li data-one="b" data-two="y">Item 2</li>
    <li data-one="e" data-two="v">Item 5</li>
  </ul>

  <script src="/js/custom-elements.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <script id=code type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    window.customElements.define('sort-stuff', class extends HTMLElement {
      connectedCallback() {
        Array.from(this.querySelectorAll('[data-key]')).forEach(
          ele => ele.addEventListener('click', this)
        );
      }

      handleEvent(e) {
        let target = document.getElementById(this.getAttribute('target'));
        let elements = [];
        let children = target.children;
        for (let i=0; i<children.length; i++) {
          elements.push({
            value: children[i].dataset[e.target.dataset.key],
            node: children[i],
          });
        }
        elements.sort((x, y) => (x.value == y.value ? 0 : (x.value > y.value ? 1 : -1)));
        elements.forEach(function(i) {
          target.appendChild(i.node);
        });
      }
    });
  </script>

  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    document.getElementById('viewcode').textContent = document.getElementById('code').textContent;
  </script>

  <p>
    Note the surfaces that were used in constructing this functionality:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>sort-stuff has an <strong>attribute</strong> &#39;target&#39; that selects the element to sort.</li>
    <li>The target <strong>children</strong> have data <strong>attributes</strong> that elements are sorted on.</li>
    <li>sort-stuff registers for &#39;click&#39; events from its <strong>children</strong>.</li>
    <li>sort-stuff <strong>children</strong> have data <strong>attributes</strong> that determine how the target children will be sorted.</li> 
  </ol>
  <p>
    In addition you could imagine adding a custom event &#39;sorted&#39; that
    &#39;sort-stuff&#39; could generate each time it sorts.
  </p>
  <p>
    So there&#39;s your six surfaces that you can use when composing elements into
    your application.  And why the insistence on making the number of surfaces
    equal six? Because while history may not repeat itself,
    <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Six_Places">it does rhyme</a>.
