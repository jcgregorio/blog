title: Bridgy, webmentions, and publishing.

[Brid.gy](https://brid.gy/about#webmentions) has a cool feature for
automatically posting blog posts to Twitter, which is interesting because it
uses Webmentions to kick off the whole process. I.e. just including the
link:

    &lt;a href="https://brid.gy/publish/twitter">&lt;/a>

Note that this also works for Facebook and flickr, and you obviously need to
authorize brid.gy to post to Twitter for you.
