  <p><a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2003_02_16.html#e001326">Dorothea</a> asked about experiences
with <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>. I am currently in the process
of re-doing the templating mechanism
in RESTLog, throwing out my hand made templating scheme 
and replacing it with Cheetah and it's been a 
great success. I initially learned of Cheetah from 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1189.html">Sam Ruby</a>
as he is using to write his own blogging software. 
The transformations are fast and Cheetah, to me, 
has struck just the right balance, sticking to
adding features needed for templating and avoiding
the tempation to become a full-blown language
on it's own, instead deferring to Python when appropriate.
</p>
<p>The NameMapper functionality is very cool. NameMapper is how
Cheetah maps names in Cheetah into names in Python. You want to get
data into the template right? So you stuff all the data into 
variables of various types. How you get to that info
in the template is handled by the NameMapper syntax.
Here is a
<a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org/docs/users_guide_html/#SECTION000650000000000000000">great example</a> from the Cheetah documentation.
</p>
<p>Cheetah definitely passes by first cut utility test, in 
adding Cheetah to RESTLog my code got smaller and cleaner.
In fact, after adding in Cheetah and my <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/35">XmlToDict.py</a> 
my templating code is only a handful of lines long.
The updated version of RESTLog, including Cheetah templating and 
support for comments, should be released by next weekend.
