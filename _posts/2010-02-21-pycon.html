title:  PyCon - Threading is not a model 

---

    <p>Here are my slides (<a href=http://bitworking.org/images/2010/02/threading-is-not-a-model.pdf>pdf</a>) 
    (<a href=http://bitworking.org/images/2010/02/threading-is-not-a-model.odp>OpenOffice</a>) from my presentation 
    "Threading is not a model" from PyCon.
    Be warned that they aren't very useful, there are no speaker notes and the slides
    themselves are pretty light on content, except for near the end of the deck where 
    it gets into Stackless Python, Go and IO code examples. If you weren't actually in
    my talk you should wait for it to appear on <a href=http://pycon.blip.tv/>pycon.blip.tv</a>.
