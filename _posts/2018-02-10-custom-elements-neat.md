title: Custom Elements "Neat"
---

>  “Neat” – as applied to drinks served in bars – refers to a shot of liquor poured directly from the bottle and into a glass. There is no chilling involved with a “neat” drink. There is never an additional ingredient in a drink served “neat”.

The [Custom Elements V1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements) spec
has reached concensus and implementations are [going well](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1),
which is all great news, but what I find surprising is the lack of
[VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) custom elements on [WebComponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/).
Doing a simple search for "vanilla" [only returns a smattering of
elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/search/vanilla) at this time.

I've been working on a set of such elements myself, and went looking for
others to compare and contrast against, and was surprised to find so little.
It would be nice to have a larger selection of "neat" elements to choose from.

For the curious, here's a screenshot of the elements I've gotten so far:

I'll point to the code once it reaches a slightly less embarassing stage.
