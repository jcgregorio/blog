title:  140 characters isn't enough 

---

    <p>We have some interesting mailing lists internally 
    at Google and one of the great temptations when starting
    is to sign up for too many of them. Over the years
    I've learned my lesson and whittled that list down, but
    one of them stuck; I had gleaned some interesting nuggets
    from that list when I first started and was loathe to unsubscribe.
    </p>
    <p>
    I recently looked at that list again and began to question
    my committment and so performed an experiment, I created a log
    file, and whenever I learned something new or useful from that
    list that I hadn't heard from another source, I would jot it down
    in the log file.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of two weeks the log was empty.</p>
    <p>I promptly unsubscribed.</p>
    <p>The experiment got me thinking about all my other 
    sources of information and the real utility that they 
    bring me. Twitter, Buzz and Reader went under the 
    same scope. 
    </p>
    <p>Reader and Buzz did well, providing me with meaty content
    that I care about, and good coversations. I'm not sure if it is the 140
    character limit, or the enforced tiny-url-ization, or the lack of threaded
    commenting, or any of the other technical constraints of Twitter, 
    but in the end I found it to be largely content-free.</p>
    <p>Today I took my Twitter profile private. 
    </p>
    <p>I haven't deleted the account yet, as there are some people
    that seem to only communicate with me via twitter DM, and I want to get
    a chance to redirect them personally to a new communication
    medium, but besides that I will no longer be using or montoring
    Twitter. At the same time I'm moving my focus back to blogging, 
    and the output of my blog will be fed into <a href=http://www.google.com/profiles/joe.gregorio>Buzz</a>, but no where
    else.
    </p>
    <p>It turns out, for me, 140 characters isn't enough.</p>
