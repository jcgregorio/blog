title: Please stop using setuptools 

---

  <p><em>(at least exclusively, for now...)</em></p>
<p>Here is my 'user experience' with <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/setuptools/">setuptools</a>, the
installation tool used by <a href="http://routes.groovie.org/">Routes</a>.
Please note that Routes is not the first package that I have used that requires
setuptools. It is just the one that put me over the edge.  </p>
<p><em>[Updated with much feedback...]</em>
</p>
  
<p> From the
Download page of Routes: </p>
<pre> Download ez_setup.py then run:

      python ez_setup.py Routes

  Or if you already have Easy Install:

      easy_install Routes </pre>
<p> Hmmm, I might already have <code>easy_install</code> installed so let's
give that a whirl: </p>
<pre>$ <b>easy_install Routes</b> bash: easy_install: command not found </pre>
<p> Ok, that's not too surprising, let's go for the ez_setup.py: </p>
<pre>$ <b>wget http://routes.groovie.org/files/ez_setup.py</b> 
08:31:50 (95.53KB/s) - `ez_setup.py.1' saved [8189/8189] </pre>
<p> And now to run it: </p>
<pre>$ <b>python ez_setup.py Routes</b>

<p>Ok, my bad; I'm on my hosted site, can't run as root so I'll add
<code>--prefix=$HOME</code>.  </p>

<p>Uhmmm, whadd'ya mean <code>--prefix</code> isn't recognized?  You're
telling me this is a setup tool that doesn't understand the common
<code>--prefix</code> parameter?  </p>

<p> What the @#$$#%#?!! You just told me <code>--help-commands</code> was a
valid option!  Fine, I'll try <code>--help</code> and see if I get any better
results.  </p>
<pre>$ <b>python ez_setup.py --help</b> 
Downloading http://cheeseshop.python.org/..a8-py2.4.egg 
Global options:
--verbose (-v)  run verbosely (default) 
--quiet (-q)    run quietly (turns verbosity off) 
--dry-run (-n)  don't actually do anything 
--help (-h)     show detailed help message
.... Lot's of other stuff ....  </pre>
<p> No prefix. Lot's of other stuff. No --prefix.  Now there is an
--install-dir, but it is rather poorly documented. Does that mean the absolute
directory, or can I just point it to ~/lib/ and it will automatically find
~/lib/python2.4/site-packages?  I'll be careful and give it a full path.  </p>
<pre>$ <b>python ez_setup.py -d ~/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ Routes</b>

  Because this distribution was installed --multi-version or 
  --install-dir, before you can import modules from this package in 
  an application, you will need to 'import pkg_resources' and then use 
  a 'require()' call similar to one of these examples, in order 
  to select the desired version:

  pkg_resources.require("Routes")  # latest installed version
  pkg_resources.require("Routes==1.1")  # this exact version
  pkg_resources.require("Routes&gt;=1.1")  # this version or higher </pre>
<p> This might look like success, except that I    had to install this locally,
which I could do easily with the old setup.py package by adding --prefix. Now
with this 'new' and 'improved' installer I can't just do <code>import
    routes</code> but instead have to use this new
<code>pkg_resources.require()</code> call? Are you seriously suggesting
   that <b>how I use a library is now dependent on how I installed it</b>?
</p>
<p>
This is not success.
</p>
<p>
I have seen success before, it looked nothing like this.
</p>
<p>
This is failure.
</p>
<p>
I start again from scratch, deleting everything.
</p>
<p>
Pull the sources for Routes from the subversion repository and 'mv' the routes
directory to 'site-packages' and cross my fingers.
</p>
<p>
All the unit tests pass. Everything works.

<p> <b>Note to all Python library developers: Please, please, please stop using setuptools.</b>
Or if you want to use setuptools, please do it <b>in addition</b> to a standard
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a> based setup.
The setuptools project is currently listed, by the author, as being in alpha.
I am sure Phillip J. Eby is hard
at work on making setuptools better, and I look forward to
all the things it will do when it's done. But it is not done,
and you, as a library developer, aren't helping the situation
by using a tool that isn't finished.
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> While this post was ostensibly <b>not</b> about
  setuptools but about those who would force an alpha level installer
  on the world, my post seems to have sparked some 
  <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2006-February/006044.html">
  activity</a>. You can follow <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2006-February/006002.html">
  this thread</a> for more details. I'm impressed with the quick responses and the obvious commitment of those 
  involved to making setuptools better.
  I'll give the setuptools author Phillip J. Eby
  the <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/2006/02/10-more-usability-twice-users.html">final word</a>.
</p>
