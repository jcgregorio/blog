title: The Technorati Lottery

---

  
  <p>So apparently <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/07/12#departmentOfConnections">some 
   of the blogosphere is aghast that </a><a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> 
   might try to make a profit. Please,
   get over it already, Dave and company didn't put up all those servers and services
   just because they didn't have anything better to do with their time and money.
</p>
<p>On balance I've got say there's a wide opening for competitors to Technorati 
   on the customer service and QOS fronts. How do <b>I</b> get my site indexed 
   by Technorati and have my posts appear under the right tags? First, I use the
   manual ping page, then about an hour later I use the manual ping page again. Then
   I use a quick bash script I wrote to call the XML-RPC ping interface. Then I wait 
   another 24 hours. Then I jump into IRC and harass Kevin Marks personally
   until my site gets indexed. <abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>.
   As tiring as this is for me, I have to believe it's even more wearing
   on Kevin.
</p>
<p>All of this so I can play the Technorati Lottery. That is, intermittently
   pressing F5 to see if I can get a screen different from this one:</p>

    <p>So far I'm batting .500, earlier this morning I got a response, right now I got: </p>

    Ignoring the fact that professional baseball players dream to bat .500, I'm counting on your batting average to increase.

    Perhaps Technorati would benefit from some techno-steroids?
