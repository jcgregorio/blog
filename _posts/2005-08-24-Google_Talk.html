  <p><a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a> just went live.</p>
<blockquote><p>They say talk is cheap. Google thinks it should be free. Google Talk enables you to call or send instant messages to your friends for free - anytime, anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>They provide a Windows client. It has a nice clean interface. It does <b>not</b> have advertising and annoying pop-ups plastered all over it.</p>
<p>Using their network requires a GMail account.</p>
<p>It uses Jabber/XMPP. Let's hear it for open standards.</p>
<p>It uses a custom protocol for the voice connection, which they claim they will fully document.
  They also plan to add support for SIP.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I'm joe.gregorio@gmail.com.</p>
