  <p>The value of uniform and simple interfaces:</p>
<blockquote><p>I've switched the blog over to a RESTLog API style implementation I whipped up in. NET, I could battle the metaWeblogApi no longer. Pingback's and tracksbacks should still be working. Let me know if you spot any problems.
I say RESTLog API style because at this point its very similarto the RESTLog API, but doesn't yet implement the spec fully. [<a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/03/1132.html">Simon Fell</a>]</p></blockquote>
