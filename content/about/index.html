<p>
  My name is Joe Gregorio and I am a happily married old white guy with four kids, two dogs, and a cat, living in sunny
  North Carolina working for <s>Google</s> Meta.
</p>
<p>
  I am a maker across a broad set of interests, including software, woodworking, and cooking.
</p>
<p>
  These days I'm mostly interested in Golang, TypeScript, Web Components, REST, and Web Standards.
</p>

<p>
  I am the co-author of two RFCs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5023/">RFC 5023 - The Atom Publishing Protocol</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6570/">RFC 6570 - URI Template</a></li>
</ul>

<p> The stuff I write occasionally gets <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jLzmP4AAAAJ">cited in
    scholarly journals</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A long time ago I wrote The RESTFul Web
  column for the online Oâ€™Reilly publication XML.com, wrote the first desktop
  aggregator written in C#, and have published various <a href="https://pypi.org/user/jcgregorio/">Python modules</a> to
  help in
  putting together RESTful web services such as mimeparse, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/httplib2/">httplib2</a>,
  and the
  google-api-python-client.
