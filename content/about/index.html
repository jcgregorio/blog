<p>
  My name is Joe Gregorio and I am the father of three boys and one girl and a
  husband to Lynne Gregorio. We live in sunny North Carolina where I work for
  Google on the <a href="https://skia.org">Skia</a> graphics library. I am the
  editor of the Atom Publishing Protocol and the coauthor of the URI Templates
  spec. I have a deep interest in web technologies: I wrote The RESTFul Web
  column for the online Oâ€™Reilly publication XML.com, wrote the first desktop
  aggregator written in C#, and have published various Python modules to help in
  putting together RESTful web services such as mimeparse, httplib2, and the
  google-api-python-client. I'm interested in Go, Polymer, Web Components, REST,
  web services, APIs, URI templates, the Atom Publishing Protocol, big data, and
  any linear combination of such.
