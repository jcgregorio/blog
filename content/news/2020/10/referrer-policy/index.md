This is a reminder from the running-just-to-stay-in-the-same-place department that
if you run a blog you probably want to set a `Referrer-Policy` header:

    Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url

- [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/07/referrer-policy-new-chrome-default)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)

This notice brought to you by the "What broke [my webmention
implementation](https://github.com/jcgregorio/webmention-run) this time?"
department.
