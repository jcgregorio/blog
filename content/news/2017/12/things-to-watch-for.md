As the current political situation unwinds there are things to watch for:

1.  Now that the GOP mega-donors have their tax cut, do Republicans become
    more open to impeaching Trump? He is a huge liability for the 2018
    mid-terms and impeachment might improve their odds as a way of distancing
    themselves from him.
2.  As impeachment for Trump looks more and more likely, look for WikiLeaks to
    start dumping compromising information on Trump. If Putin can't have a
    compromised politician in the White House then he can at least maximize
    the chaos. Also, WikiLeaks will point to such a dump of information
    and try to claim that they are unbiased.
3.  Once impeachment proceedings start, look for Russia to make further inroads
    into Ukraine.
