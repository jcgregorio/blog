[Chuck Schumer Says Senate Democrats Are Open To Single-Payer Health Care](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-schumer-single-payer_us_5974b05be4b00e4363e0164e)

> “We’re going to look at broader things [for health care],” he said.

Yeah, **bold** leadership always comes from phrases like "on the table". Don't
you remember [Churchill's famous
speech](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/winston-churchill/11366880/Winston-Churchills-10-most-important-speeches.html)?

> Going to the end is on the table. Fighting in France is on the table, fighting on the

> in the air is something we're certainly willing to talk about.

The leadership on display here is just pathetic.

A simple bold platform is very easy to state, and also one that's easy to
support. Additionally, if you keep it direct you can more easily construct
radical arguments to move the [Overton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) window.
For example, on just three issues, the platform could be boldly and simply
stated, and the Overton postions below are the ones you get some people to
state, so that the platform position looks like a reasonable compromise.

Healthcare
----------

**Platform**: Medicare for all.

**Overton**: Let's nationalize hospitals and shut down the health insurance industry.

Education
---------

**Platform**: Free college education (up to a bachelor's degree).


**Overton**: Let's nationalize the education system and extend mandatory education from a high school diploma to a bachelor's degree.

Taxes
-----

**Platform**: Return to a progressive tax system where the wealthy pay their
fair share and loopholes are closed.

**Overton**: A top marginal income tax rate of 90%.


Now aren't those a lot more appealing than the mealy mouthed alternatives?
