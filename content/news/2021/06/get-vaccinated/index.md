From the Cleveland Clinic,
[Most COVID-19 Infections and Hospitalizations are in Unvaccinated](https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2021/05/12/most-covid-19-infections-and-hospitalizations-are-in-unvaccinated/).

> “From January first to around mid-April, we’ve had around 4,300 admissions to
> the hospital with COVID. Of those patients, 99% were not fully vaccinated,”
> said Eduardo Mireles, MD, Director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

So in case it isn't obvious, please get vaccinated.

Also, we all know the majority of people not getting vaccinated are the
followers of
[Winnie The Coup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSBx9QNhJU8&t=63s), which will
only fuel more conspiracy theories in future years when, for some unknown
reason, the percentage of R deaths, hospitalizations, and instances of long
Covid will be found to swamp the rest of the US population.
