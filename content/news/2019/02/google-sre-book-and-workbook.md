I never realized the detail that the Google SRE book provided
[on the production environment at Google](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/),
including such things as D, Colossus, Jupiter, BNS, and GSLB.

Also there's now [The Site Reliability Workbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/), a hands-on implementation guide.
