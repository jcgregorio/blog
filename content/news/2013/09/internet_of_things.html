 <p>So while everyone was losing their minds over the addition of the
 word <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/twerk">twerk</a> to the  <a href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/august-2013-update/">Oxford
 Dictionaries Online</a>, I&#39;m actually more upset that the <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Internet-of-things">Internet
 of Things</a> was added with the wrong definition, or at least an incomplete
 definiton.
</p>
<blockquote>
a proposed development of the Internet in which everyday objects have network
connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data
</blockquote>
<p>
 The first definitions of the Internet of Things I heard was from
 Bruce Sterling and it went beyond just having network connectivity, it was about lifecycle management, tracking
 objects from cradle to grave. Now I understand that the
 ODO tracks popular usage of a term, and that literally everyone is using
 the term wrong, so the wrong term gets added to the dictionary (did you see
 what I did there?). I&#39;m OK with the simpler definition being added to the ODO,
 but it unfortunately means that we don&#39;t have a word for the richer
 definition of the Internet of Things, which is an important concept that we shouldn&#39;t lose sight of.
