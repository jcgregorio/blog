<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/piccolo-pub/">Piccolo</a> has been ported to Go.
The original Python script is still in place, but will no longer be updated.
This entry is the first one published with the new <code>picc.go</code>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a speed comparison between the Python and the Go code for a full
republish, i.e. every HTML file needs to be rewritten. First for the old Python
code:</p>

<pre><code>
$ ./bin/piccolo
real  0m57.491s
user  0m46.415s
sys 0m1.312s
</code></pre>

<p>And now the Go code:</p>

<pre><code>
$ ./bin/picc
real  0m4.460s
user  0m1.588s
sys 0m1.096s
</code></pre>

<p>And incremental publishing is under a second:</p><p>

</p><pre><code>
$ ./bin/picc
real  0m0.476s
user  0m0.404s
sys 0m0.068s
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <i>incremental</i> isn&#39;t a very good description
since the program is still parsing close to 1,000 XML files
in that last run. I obviously have some performance improvements
I can make.
