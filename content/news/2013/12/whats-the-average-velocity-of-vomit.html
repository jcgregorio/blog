  Due to suspected food poisoning I checked into the local emergency room last
  night around 2 AM, trusty 13 gallon plastic garbage bag in hand, because,
  I&#39;ve been throwing up. Once they get me into a room the nurse offers me a
  shallow pink plastic pan in exchange for my plastic garbage bag, and I&#39;m
  thinking to myself, &#34;Really, have you never seen anyone vomit in your
  entire life?&#34;. Why on earth would you offer me a shallow round bottom
  plastic pan as an alternative to a 13 gallon plastic garbage bag? This is
  vomit we&#39;re trying to contain here. This reminds me of a previous visit to
  the same ER with my son when he had appendicitis, this time we came in with a
  kitchen garbage pail and the nurse laughed at us and handed him a small metal
  kidney dish. My son held it in his hands, looking at it perplexedly for about
  five seconds before he started vomiting again, turning it from a kidney dish
  into a shiny metal parabolic broadcast spreader of vomit.

  I don&#39;t know what to make of this phenomenon, as I thought that working in
  an ER would expose you to a lot of puking people, and thus you&#39;d know
  better than to give someone a kidney dish to throw up in. I can only come up
  with two possible conclusions, the first that the ER folks are just aren&#39;t
  quick learners and haven&#39;t picked up on the association:
</p>
<pre>kidney dish : vomit :: broadcast spreader : grass seed</pre>
<p>
  The other possibility is that my family is unique, maybe my wife and I are
  both descended from long lines of projectile vomitters, a long and honorable
  tradition of high velocity emesis, and that the rest of population is filled
  with polite, low volume, low velocity vomitters. If so, you people make me
  sick.
