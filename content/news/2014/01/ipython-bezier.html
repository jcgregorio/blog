<p>
So I've been impressed with <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> so far,
it can be a little fiddly to install, but given the power I'm not going to
complain. I'm now working on <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/skia">graphics</a> and in trying to get up to
speed going back and learning, or relearning, some basics. Today was BÃ©zier
curves, and thus <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/ipython/bezier.html">this IPython notebook</a>. Note that the content there isn't
actually educational, you should follow the links provided to really learn
about these constructs, I just wanted an excuse to try out LaTeX and plot some
interesting graphs.
