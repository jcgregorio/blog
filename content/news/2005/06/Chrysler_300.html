<p>The first time I saw the new Chrylser 300 I hated it.</p>
<p>The next time I saw it I was intrigued.</p>
<p>The third time I saw it the Dick-Tracy-Muscle-Car-Terra-Plane shape had firmly wrapped it's tentacles around my lizard brain.</p>
<p>I don't own one.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>

    <p>I use a car service for some of my business trips (travel to the airport).  The service I like best uses the 300 and it is a spectacular car for this purpose.  </p>
<p>From the perspective of a rider in the back seat, the car if very comfortably and spacious.  It also has enough cup holders and arm rest space to be quite functional as an en-route office.</p>
<p>I haven't driven the car, but the drivers have all commented that they like the car very much, and since they're driving for 6+ hours a day I think their opinion is quite valuable.</p>
