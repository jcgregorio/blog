  <p>Not that I'm rooting for the demise of SVG, but I'm quite suprised by the
  quick uptake of its direct competitor, the canvas element. Here, for example, is the 
  beginning of a <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#scs-dynamic">canvas</a> 
  implementation for IE:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://me.eae.net/archive/2005/12/29/canvas-in-ie/">Emil</a>: Using VML, in combination with behaviors, it should therefor be possible to emulate a subset of SVG or Canvas in IE. That's the idea I got a few days ago when working on a basic drawing abstraction, and according to Google a few others have thought along those lines as well. Couldn't find any actual implementation though so I decided to make my own, how hard could it be?
