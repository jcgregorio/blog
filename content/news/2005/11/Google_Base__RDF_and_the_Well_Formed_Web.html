  <p>So Google launched <a href="base.google.com">Google Base</a>, 
  and <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002033.php">John Battelle 
  points back</a> to Paul Ford's
  article <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/google_takes_all.html">August 2009: How Google 
  beat Amazon and Ebay to the Semantic Web</a>. 
  There's only one little problem with pointing back to 
  Paul's essay in the light of Google Base and that problem is that Paul
  was wrong. The entire point of Paul's speculative essay is that 
  "Google Marketplace", as Paul named it, was driven by RDF and
  the Semantic Web.  Here we are three years later and 
  Google Base is live but there's no RDF involved; not an ontology in sight. 
  Just like I said three years ago 
  in <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/WellFormedWeb">The Well-Formed Web</a>,
  the vision is nice, it just doesn't need RDF.
