   <p>From the wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_service_attack">
                    Denial-of-service</a> attacks:</p>
<blockquote><p>A denial-of-service attack (also, DoS attack) is an attack on a computer system
                    or network that causes a loss of service to users, typically the loss of network
                    connectivity and services by consuming the bandwidth of the victim network or
                    overloading the computational resources of the victim system.
                    </p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, one vector of attack to pay attention to is</p>
<blockquote><p>consumption of computational resources, such as bandwidth, disk space, or CPU time</p></blockquote>
<p>
                    This kind of attack is successful because of an inherent asymmetry between the
                    attacker and the attacked. The attacker performs very little computation
                    to send the packets, but the server has to accept them and perform some computation
                    to determine if they are valid or bogus. In this way an attacker with the same
                    or less computational power can overwhelm a bigger host.
                    </p><p>
</p><p>
                    These same kinds of attacks are repeated in many different kinds of
                    media where the asymmetry is present. For example sending
                    email is practically computation free, but reading
                    and processing it takes time. The result? Spam. With the advent of
                    many competing blogging services starting a blog is also practically
                    free, and the predictable result is
                    <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/14/Splogs">splogs</a>.
                    </p>
<p>
                    There are different kinds of defenses, but the one I want you
                    to keep in mind is removing the asymmetry, making the computation
                    requirements on both sides closer in parity. The importance of this
                    will become apparent in a bit.

<h3>Getting Social</h3>
<p>
                    The reason I bring this up is because not only do denial of
                    service attacks occur in electronic networks, they also occur
                    in the real world. The one I want to talk about is the
                    "social denial-of-service" attack. This can happen, for instance,
                    in the case of an IETF Working Group where all of the work
                    is supposed to be consensus based. In that scenario it is

                    very easy for an attacker to derail progress with a constant stream
                    of objections and wildly divergent proposals.
                    </p>
<p>
                    The IETF, being the IETF, has an RFC for this.
                    </p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3683.html">RFC 3683 - A Practice for Revoking Posting Rights to IETF Mailing Lists</a>:
                    </p>
<blockquote><p>
                        Notably, in a small number of cases, a participant has engaged in
                        what amounts to a "denial-of-service" attack to disrupt the
                        consensus-driven process.  Typically, these attacks are made by
                        repeatedly posting messages that are off-topic, inflammatory, or
                        otherwise counter-productive.  In contrast, good faith disagreement
                        is a healthy part of the consensus-driven process.
                        </p><p>
                        For example, if a working group is unable to reach consensus, this is
                        an acceptable, albeit unfortunate, outcome; however, if that working
                        group fails to achieve consensus because it is being continuously
                        disrupted, then the disruption constitutes an abuse of the
                        consensus-driven process.  Interactions of this type are
                        fundamentally different from "the lone voice of dissent" in which a
                        participant expresses a view that is discussed but does not achieve
                        consensus.  In other words, individual bad faith should not trump
                        community goodwill.
                        </p>

<p>
                    Let's go back to electronic denial-of-service attacks. They worked
                    because of an inherent asymmetry between the attacker and the
                    attacked. The same is true of the social denial-of-service attack where
                    arguments, responses, rebuttals and more importantly time has to be spent
                    responding to the bad faith objections, which are easily written up
                    and tossed onto the mailing list.
                    </p>
<p>
                    Remember that one way to fight a denial of service attack is to
                    raise the amount of computation required by the attacker. In the case of
                    a Working Group the way to do that is by requiring disruptions
                    to take more time and energy. This is where the call for "camera ready
                    copy in the form of a Pace" comes from in the AtomPub WG. Camera
                    ready copy is much more difficult to write than a one or two line
                    objection tossed into a mailing list. Only if you are willing to
                    put in the work to write up a Pace with reasonable text will it
                    start to take up the time of the WG. Your willingness to
                    put in the time and effort to create camera ready copy
                    will distinguish your proposals and objections from
                    those of an attacker.
                    </p>
<p>
                    So if you are participating in the AtomPub WG don't be put off
                    if you're asked to put up a Pace with "camera ready copy", you
                    are after all helping in the fight against social denial-of-service
                    attacks.
