  <p>Thomas Friedman, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0374292884&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325">
  The World is Flat</a> has an editorial,
   <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/29/opinion/edfried.php">The End of the Rainbow</a> in which he reports
   that Ireland is the second richest country in the EU, right after Luxembourg.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Yes, the country that for hundreds of years was best known for emigration,
tragic poets, famines, civil wars and leprechauns today has a per capita
gross domestic product higher than that of Germany, France and Britain.
How Ireland went from the sick man of Europe to the rich man in less than a
generation is an amazing story. It tells you a lot about Europe today:
All the innovation is happening on the periphery by those countries embracing
globalization in their own ways - Ireland, Britain, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe -
while those following the French-German social model are suffering high unemployment and low growth.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
   That's pretty remarkable in itself, but what is more interesting is the
   pro-business steps it took to achieve that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And change Ireland did. In a quite unusual development, the government,
  the main trade unions, farmers and industrialists came together and agreed
  on a program of fiscal austerity, slashing corporate taxes to 12.5 percent,
  far below the rest of Europe, moderating wages and prices, and aggressively
  courting foreign investment. In 1996, Ireland made college education basically
  free, creating an even more educated work force.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, and national healthcare.</p>
<p>So here's a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free college education</li>
<li>National healthcare</li>
<li>Low corporate taxes that are simple and transparent</li>
<li>Actively seek out global companies</li>
<li>Open your economy to competition</li>
<li>Keep your fiscal house in order</li>
<li>Build a consensus around the whole package with labor and management</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine that, national healthcare as a pro-business policy. </p>
<p>
   Unfortunately, with our current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system">two-party system</a>, barring
   some kind of catastrophe, I don't see
   free college education, national healthcare and low
   corporate taxes that are simple and transparent
   ever happening here in the US.

    <p>My goal is health care that is of high quality, and available to everyone. That said, I distrust both the <b>health care industry</b>, and government to provide solutions. Each of them have agendas, neither of which are necessarliy in the interests of <b>average folks</b>. I agree with your distrust of the 2ps, but I do not see howÂ  <b>National healthcare</b>, is necessarily a good idea.</p>
<p>This policy list looks good, but the devil is in the details. How is this paid for? <br />
Free, or very low cost, post high school education is important for a competitive economy, but it is also not cheap. </p>
<p>It would be helpful to see how they are paying for all of this.</p>
