  <p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.easternct.edu/depts/edu/free/free.htm">Dr. Rhona Free</a> for winning the 
  <a href="http://www.case.org/Content/POY/Display.cfm?contentItemID=4706">National 2004 CASE Professor of the Year</a>.
  I took several classes with Dr. Free and they were all excellent, to the point that I was seriously tempted to 
  switch to Economics as a major. I'm very glad to see her get the recognition that she deserves. And I'm also glad to see
  that she is still at <a href="http://www.easternct.edu/">Eastern</a>, which is filled with great professors
  truly interested in teaching.
