   I seemed to stumble across them at just the right time, as I have regression tests I
   am adding to on a daily basis. The result is a flood of information.
   I believe sparklines may be the answer to my information avalanche. 
</p>
<p>All of my regression scripts are written
   in Python and the output of those scripts
   is HTML. Embedding sparklines in that report output sounds like a perfect application
   of "data: URIs" <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397">[RFC 2397]</a>, which allow you to 
   take small bits of data, like small images, and instead of serving them up seperately, you 
   embed the data right into the URI. In this case, I'll generate PNG formatted sparklines
   then encode them as data URIs that can be included directly in my HTML formatted 
   regression test results.
   So I dashed off to find a sparklines module for Python. </p>
<p>
   I found none.</p>
<p> I did find one 
   for PHP, <a href="http://sparkline.org/">http://sparkline.org</a>, but that would
   not be Python now would it?</p>
<p>Not to be discouraged, I set off to load up the standard image manipulation
   package for Python.</p>
<p>Crud.</p>
<p>Explain to me again why doesn't Python have a standard image manipulation
   package? </p>
<p>I settled on <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a>.</p>
<p>Making the sparklines turned out to be incredibly easy, making me think that the reason there
    wasn't any libraries is that it's just so easy to glue the right
    pieces together in Python that a library would be overkill.
    Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>
import Image, ImageDraw
import StringIO
import urllib

def plot_sparkline(results):
   """Returns a sparkline image as a data: URI.
       The source data is a list of values between
       0 and 100. Values greater than 95
       are displayed in red, otherwise they are displayed
       in green"""
   im = Image.new("RGB", (len(results)*2, 15), 'white')
   draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)
   for (r, i) in zip(results, range(0, len(results)*2, 2)):
       color = (r &gt; 50) and "red" or "gray"
       draw.line((i, im.size[1]-r/10-4, i, (im.size[1]-r/10)), fill=color)
   del draw

   f = StringIO.StringIO()
   im.save(f, "PNG")
   return 'data:image/png,' + urllib.quote(f.getvalue())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import random
    html = """
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Does my sparkline 
                &lt;img src="%s"&gt; 
            fit in a nice paragraph of text?
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;"""
    print html % plot_sparkline([random.randint(0, 100) for i in range(30)])
</code></pre>
<p>The example output is just a plot of 30 random values. You should put more
   meaningful data in there. All the work is done on <tt>plot_sparkline</tt>, which 
   plots the data as 4 pixel high bars in an image that is 15 pixels high. After
   the binary PNG image is generated, converting it to a data URI is staggeringly easy, 
   it's done in the return statement of <tt>plot_sparkline</tt>. The output of the
   script is a sample HTML file to demonstrate the sparkline embedded in the
   HTML.
</p>
<p>The above code produces output that should look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Does my sparkline   
    <img src="data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%3C%00%00%00%0F%08%02%00%00%007p%3B%26%00%00%01%1EIDATx%9Cb%FC%FF%FF%3F%C3P%03%00%00%00%00%FF%FFb%1Ah%07%90%03%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%1AhG32bg%E3%05%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2%9E%A3%89%B6%92r%00%00%00%00%FF%FFb%A2%A7e%24%03%1Cn%03%00%00%00%FF%FF%C2%16%D2%98Jqy%8C%12%0F%93%950%20%00%00%00%00%FF%FFBu4%05%06%91%00%90MF.%BB%88%29%C7%18%19%19%18%18%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%82%3A%BA%B1%B1%91H%1B%21%2A%B1%A8%C7%B0%92x3q%D9%82%0B%00%00%00%00%FF%FFb%22%CA%7F%14%00%9C%9E%24%06%E0p%1B%00%00%00%FF%FF%C2%96%A61%95%E2%F2%18%89%1EFq%3A%A9%09%03%09%00%00%00%00%FF%FFBu4%86A%A4%86%10Q%EA%C9%F2%2A%D4%E4%FF%FF%19%18%18%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%82%3A%BA%BE%BE%9EH%CD%10%95%C8%EA1%1D%8A%AC%92T%40%8C%5E%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2y%8D%88%E9I%CA%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2k5N-%A7%03%00%00%00%FF%FF%22%E0hR%AD%A1n%88%22%9B%89l2%00%00%00%FF%FF%03%00%A1%AEI%27%21%F0V%C1%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82" />

<p><b>Update 3:</b> Highlighting the minimum point in is a matter of adding two more lines, one to find the minimum, and another to plot a rectangle at that point. While Tufte has pointed out that sparklines are targeted at high resolution printing, there are advantages to working with them on the computer. For example, on a web page we can put the raw data into the title of the image and they will be displayed when the mouse hovers over the sparkline. Try it out, hover your mouse over the image: <img src="data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%2A%00%00%00%14%08%02%00%00%00t%D18%D1%00%00%01-IDATx%9Cb%FC%FF%FF%3F%C3%C0%01%00%00%00%00%FF%FFb%1A%40%BB%19%18%18%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%60%EB%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%60%EB%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%60%EB%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%60%EB%01%00%00%00%FF%FFb%A1%9BM%9D%9D%9D%10Fyy9%5C%10%00%00%00%FF%FFb%F8O%17%D0%D1%D1%81%E000%40%D1%FF%FF%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%22%CA%F7p%87cq%3Eq%DAqi%01%00%00%00%FF%FFb%E8%E8%E8%40q%1A%86%AB1e%F1%A8%27%E0o%0C%DF%03%00%00%00%FF%FFb%FC%FF%FF%3Ff%C4%60%8F%27%22%3DD%8A2%00%00%00%00%FF%FFB%8F%7B%FC%81AR%18%10c%0E%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2%28%E9%E1%8F5bL%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2%28%DF%97%97%97%A3%A5JR%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2B%C6%83x%14%29%3D%91%906%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2N%BE%EF%E8%E8%80%5BOR%BE%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%82%A6%7C%CA%01%23%23%3C8I%D0%05%00%00%00%FF%FF%A2Z%A1K%9E/%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%E0%2A%07%00%00%00%FF%FF%1A%60%EB%01%00%00%00%FF%FF%03%00%AC%8B%E6%A2%D5%C6%A4%93%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82" title="[63, 60, 57, 53, 50, 48, 48, 50, 53, 58, 63, 69, 73, 77, 78, 77, 73, 66, 57, 47, 35, 24, 14, 7, 2, 1, 3, 9, 18, 30, 43, 56, 68, 78, 86, 91, 92, 90, 85, 78]" /> <b style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color:#0000FF">1</span> <span style="color:#FF0000">78</span></b>.

    The Python Imaging Library pretty much /is/ the standard image manipulation package - at least it's the only one I ever see used or discussed. Are you saying it should be included in the Python standard library?

    <p>I like this solution, because it's self-contained. I was trying to solve the same problem, and my idea was to write a CGI script that returned the image, so you could something like this:</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/spark.cgi?data=1,2,3,4,5" /&gt;</p>
<p>But I think inline PNGs make a nice solution. And if you use the sparklines just for <em>additional</em> information, people with IE won't miss much.</p>

    Pythonware, which writes PIL, make their money off custom programming jobs, usually extending their code for clients with specific needs.  As a result, they need the ability to make releases on their own schedule (or on their clients' schedules), which doesn't mesh well with the standard library.  At least, that's my impression.

    There's no "point". It's what I (and a few other readers, one may only assume) have. From your log stats: how many hit do you get from IE?

    <p>Sorry to disappoint you Ziv, but the majority of my readership can see those images. And I believe I am performing a public service by encouraging the rest to upgrade to something besides IE.</p>
<p>55%	Mozilla <br />
37%	IE <br />
4%	Safari<br />
3%	Opera</p>

    I'm not disappointed at all. Your own stats mean that a third of your readership can't see what you meant (at least not without some considerable effort). If you don't care for leaving us out, well, that's your decision.

    <p>Hmm, I thought livejournal was better indexed than this, but it also looks like I never got around to posting the python code I give example output from here: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/eichin/39893.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/eichin/39893.html</a></p>
<p>It's only about 50 lines of basic PIL plotting, and then using .tostring("jpeg") and base64.encodestring to produce the drop-into-blog output.  As noted, enough people-I-care about used browsers where the data trick didn't work... but also, livejournal has a (reasonable) 64K/post limit, and the data encoding ran into that <b>very</b> easily in my early experiments - remember that even if the image format is compressed, the wrapper-format has to be valid attribute data (and I think base64 should average <b>smaller</b> than urllib.quote in practice...)</p>
<p>Definitely something to integrate more directly, I really like the directly-in-textile approach mentioned above.</p>

    Browsers: konqueror 3.3.1 (fedora 3) can't show the data: sparkline either.

    <p>To those it didn't occur to (almost me), do "view source" to see how big these things are.  ~800 bytes of %00%02...</p>
<p>konqueror?  more like luzor!  just kidding.</p>

    <p>Yeah, anything included via the data: URL scheme does take up a fair bit of space due to the encoding.  BUT... it saves a second round-trip to the server to fetch the image.  So whereas it might cost more in data, they'll usually load faster.  In fact, you're guaranteed that the image has loaded by the time the page has loaded. :-)</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the data: URL scheme.  I used to use it with XML stuff... say a product catalog has a picture, if you store that picture Base64-encoded in the original XML content, then you can XSLT it into an image with a data: URL and pretty much go straight to the PDF with that.</p>
<p>It's also an elite way to fool sites like LiveJournal into hosting your images which they wouldn't ordinarily host. :-)</p>
