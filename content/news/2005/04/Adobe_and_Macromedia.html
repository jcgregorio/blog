  <p>So Adobe is buying Macromedia.</p>
<blockquote><p>The deal combines Adobe's Acrobat, which enables users to create, view, share and print documents, with Macromedia's Flash and Shockwave software. [<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1462780,00.html">Guardian Unlimited</a>]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Great. So does this mean that every time I view a web
  page that utilizes Flash I'll get to see this:</p>

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    Heh :) , that's a good one.<br />
Indeed, that's one of the annoying things about the (formely known as) Acrobat Reader.
