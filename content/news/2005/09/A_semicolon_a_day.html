  <p>What is it in my nature that after
   hearing that the 
   <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/0ca549d2-25a9-11da-a4a7-00000e2511c8.html">semicolon is viewed so poorly</a>
   that I would want to try to use semicolons more;
   to promise to use at least one in every weblog entry
   for next month?
</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    Bah. Is "to promise to use at least one in every weblog entry for next month" really an independent clause?  I think a dash would be more appropriate there.
