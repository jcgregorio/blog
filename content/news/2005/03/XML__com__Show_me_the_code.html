  <p>My latest article, 
  the inappropriately named 
  <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/03/02/restful.html">Show me the code</a>, 
  is now up on XML.com. Inappropriately named since I never get around
  to the code in the article. An actual implementation will be worked out
  in future installments. </p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    That article is really, really good. Your other columns were good, but this one is just excellent. I'm going to blog on it.
