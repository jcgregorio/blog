<p>A couple weeks back <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/">Bruce Sterling</a>
   came to town and gave <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=644061">a talk at Kamphoefner Hall on the NC State campus</a>. It was a standing room only crowd for the event that was co-sponsored by the  Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program and the design center.</p>
<p>It was an excellent, wide-ranging talk. If you didn't make it to the talk, you can
   see him cover many of the same ideas in a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/16/bruce_sterlings_desi.html">
   streaming video of his talk</a> at Germany's 
   "Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen"
</p>
<p>Thanks to Suzanne Stanard for the pictures of the event.</p>
