  <p>It looks like president is trying to 
  <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2005/07/28/war_on_terror/index_np.html">rename the "war on terror"</a> to "a global struggle against violent extremism".</p>
<p>And here I though they were gonna use "Police action on terror".</p>

    I think we can all agree that 'war on terror' wasn't a great catchphrase. World War 3.0, now that will make everyone happy.
