  <p>It's not like Lynne and I were sitting around, raising four kids, keeping a full time job, a part-time job, another part-time job, and 
   saying to ourselves, "What are we going to <b>do</b> will all our free time?". What we were thinking is that
   remodeling is something that we both enjoy and honestly playing stock option bingo isn't going
   to be our path to riches.
</p>
  
<p>Lynne did a lot of legwork and found this great little lake front property. We both liked it 
  not because it looked great, but because it had the <em>potential</em> to look great.</p>

<p>As you can see, the fixtures and appliances haven't been updated
   since it was built 20 years ago, from the beige-never-offended-anyone color scheme 
   right down to the flower wallpaper in the kitchen. The only thing was new 
   was the carpet, which was deep, and blue and had to go. We felt bad about throwing out
   something that new so we posted to craigslist that it was free for the taking, 
   in which 'taking' included pulling it up off the floor yourself. We had two takers
   who removed about 70% of the carpet. 
</p>
<p>The final remodel will include new paint on all the walls, bamboo floors in the living room, dining room, and hallways,
   berber carpets in the bedrooms, tile on the kitchen floor and counter tops, new(er) appliances, and
   refaced cabinets, plus all new fixtures. In addition we just had to do something architectural
   with that passthrough between the dining room and the kitchen. The size and shape of the opening
   made the kitchen feel small and cramped.
</p>
<p>We've been working on the place for close to a month now and are making 
   good progress. Here are some shots from a couple weeks ago:</p>

<p>The passthrough has been lowered and a breakfast nook added at the same level.
   The opening is also wider, with the columns and recessed lighting adding
   some structure to the space.</p>
