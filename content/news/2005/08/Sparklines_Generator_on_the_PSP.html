  <p>We are now the proud owners of a <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx" title="PlayStation Portable">PSP</a>. 
   After upgrading to the 2.0 firmware 
   the first order of business was
   to connect the wifi. After several false starts, and after upgrading
   the firmware on the Linksys Wireless Access Point, I finally succeeded. 
   I was pleasantly suprised to find that the PSP web browser worked out
   of the box with my <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines">Sparklines Generator</a>.
