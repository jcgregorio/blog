  <p><a href="http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt/archives/000423.html#nidPV2">Chris Dent</a>, who now works for Socialtext (how did I miss that?), writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These troubles matter little
and will be solved: Late last night when I was editing, creating and
deleting pages within a Socialtext workspace with both Perl and Python
test clients, scales were scraped from my eyes, walls fell down, and
objects once distant on the horizon were brought into clear relief.
Sure, there are <a href="http://blog.kung-foo.tv/archives/001532.php" class="extlink">lots of Weblog APIs</a>,
but none in my experience has the comfy feel had by Atom in the wild.
Atom is complicated and you can feel it, but you can also feel that it
could end up doing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-04.txt">some fun stuff</a> in a clean way that brings the web another step closer to being a big storehouse of knowledge <i>reusable</i> (not just usable) by anyone. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incredibly gratifying to hear. I'm setting up a subversion repsitory for
  wxAtomClient and folding in the patches that Chris has sent me. It should
  show up on the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/">projects</a> page any
  day now.
