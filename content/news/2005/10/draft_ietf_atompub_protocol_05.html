  <p>The latest draft of the Atom Publishing Protocol 
  is now available: <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-05</a>.
  This is the first draft with my new co-editor <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/">
  Bill de HÃ“ra</a> and I'd like to publicly 
  thank him for his work on this draft and for volunteering for the thankless job of working
  with me going forward.

    <p>Huge congrats. I didn't realize you two were working so heavily on the publishing side. </p>
<p>Is it just me or is the publishing protocol not getting nearly as much attention as the format? I guess it makes sense that it would be less since many more people are involved in consuming feeds than are publishing but still...</p>
<p>At any rate, I'll definitely have to give this a thorough read. What's the activity like on the mailing list? Is it atom formatish? I really couldn't keep up with that amount of traffic but I'd like to watch you guys if its not overly crazy...</p>
