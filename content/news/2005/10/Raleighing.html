  <p>Ok, color me weird but I am an absolute sucker for urban planning. 
  Raleigh is currently working on a massive downtown development plan
  that includes a new convention center, hotels and other amenities.
  Instead of wading through the government sites myself I leave that
  to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.raleighing.com/">Raleighing</a>
  who do an excellent job of keeping me informed. Check out the 
  <a href="http://www.raleighconvention.com/tour/">virtual tour</a>
  of the not yet constructed convention center. It is just me or does
  the inside look like the Chicago 
  <a href="http://www.raleighconvention.com/tour/">McCormick Place</a>
  Convention Center?
