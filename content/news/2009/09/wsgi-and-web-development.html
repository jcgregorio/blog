        Jacob Kaplan-Moss has published his <a href=http://jacobian.org/writing/snakes-on-the-web/>talk he gave
            at PyCon Argentina and PyCon Brazil 2009</a>. A really good
        write-up, I would like to just pick one small part out:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Even worse, tools like WSGI and Rack do nothing to help
            inter-language inter-operability. I’d really like to write parts of
            my application in Python, parts in Clojure, parts in Ruby, and even
            parts in Perl. Things like web proxies, SOA, ROA, and language VMs
            help, here, but since gateways aren’t APIs there’s only so far we
            can go.</p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
        If you're looking for efficient inter-language interop, I would 
        suggest looking at <a href=http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>protocol buffers</a>.
