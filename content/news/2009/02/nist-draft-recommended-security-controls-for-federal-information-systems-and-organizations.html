So I just got back from a two day trip to Washington, DC. 
As a result I am now reading, well <i>skimming</i>, the 
<q>DRAFT Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</q>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    NIST announces the release of the Initial Public Draft (IPD) of Special
    Publication 800-53, Revision 3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
    Information Systems and Organizations. This is the first major update of
    Special Publication 800-53 since its initial publication in December 2005.
    We have received excellent feedback from our customers during the past
    three years and have taken this opportunity to provide significant
    improvements to the security control catalog. In addition, the changing
    threat environment and growing sophistication of cyber attacks necessitated
    specific changes to the allocation of security controls and control
    enhancements in the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact baselines.
    We also continue to work closely with the Department of Defense and the
    Office of the Director of National Intelligence under the auspices of the
    Committee on National Security Systems on the harmonization of security
    control specifications across the federal government. And lastly, we have
    added new security controls to address organization-wide security programs
    and introduced the concept of a security program plan to capture security
    program management requirements for organizations. The privacy-related
    material, originally scheduled to be included in Special Publication
    800-53, Revision 3, will undergo a separate public review process in the
    near future and be incorporated into this publication, when completed.
