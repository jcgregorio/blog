title: Selected quotes on REST and empty window interfaces

  <p>
The impetus for this post in part comes from a conversation 
I had at PyCon. A developer had admitted that in
the past he had served up a high-traffic web page that was the same
for every visitor, but then used a bit of Javascript to pull up
the users information separately to customize the page, but he
felt "dirty" doing it.
That was pretty surprising to me because it's a perfect use of Javascript, 
and it highlights a misunderstanding about the role of Javascript in
the web.

    I don't know which way it will go but I would suggest that if we are 
    searching for what exactly the web *is* we have to go further than say it is
    HTML, as Hugh does in this piece.
    </p>
<p>
    For me, the web is URIs, a standard set of verbs and a standardized EVAL
    function. The verbs are mostly GET and POST and the standardized EVAL function
    is the concept of a browser that can EVAL HTML and can eval JavaScript. I don't
    thing we can afford to leave JavaScript out of the top level definition of what
    the Web is because there is too much at stake.

<p>The short answer is that using Javascript can be RESTful:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_7">Fielding Dissertation - Section 5.1.7</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    The final addition to our constraint set for REST comes from the code-on-demand
    style of Section 3.5.3 (Figure 5-8). REST allows client functionality to be
    extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.
    This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be
    pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after deployment improves
    system extensibility. <b>However, it also reduces visibility</b>, and thus is only an
    optional constraint within REST.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The emphasis is my own, and is the crux of the problem, that using too much Javascript can
reduce visibility, not only to intermediaries, but also to other denizens 
of the web, like crawlers.
</p>
<p>
There is a broad range on which Javascript can be applied in building
a web site, from sites that use HTML and CSS only, to sites that
require Javascript to access <em>any</em> functionality. 
The latter are what I call "empty window" interfaces, because
if you visit the site with Javascript turned off all you're 
going to see is an "empty window".

<p>
    You're barking up the wrong tree here. GWT is for writing
    AJAX/RIA/whatever-you-want-to-call-them applications. It makes the
    obnoxious JS bits tolerable. JS applications are inherently unfriendly
    to search engines. You can overcome that (as Ian has done) but it
    isn't going to be as simple as tossing an HTML file on some random web
    server and having it indexed. 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's picking the right range for your application to sit in 
that matters, and picking that range depends on how searchable
you want to be.

NIST is assembling standards around SaaS, and one component of 
that standard is understanding the value of the data versus the 
risk of it being exposed. We need a similar decision framework 
for web applications, but in this case the reverse, the value of 
the data versus the risk of it not being indexed.

    <p>We do the same thing in our project -- serve up a standard page for everyone, then pull up customized code for the user.  In some cases it is not just personalization but, say, a bit of content that was changed by a user action and needs to be refreshed (w/o wanting to re-render the entire page).
</p><p>
Whenever it IS possible, I try to follow the HATEOS principle of REST and not let javascript construct the URL, but rather have the target URL sit in a link element on the page. The link@rel lets the javascript find the proper link and send off the request.  If I am not mistaken, that would help for search optimization as well.  As long as the content is "surfaced," in this case by a link on the page, I assume the crawler can get to it.
</p><p>
And while it's often not possible, I'd like to see more folks embed link@rel=alternate in their web pages that points to a more highly structure "version" of the content/data there.  My preference is Atom, but I suspect RDF would be fine for that as well. Nicely illustrated by http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh95000541

    My current thinking is that when you create a full-blown AJAX (including GWT) app, you need a "mobile"/simple version anyway.
<p>
Using <tt>rel=canonical</tt>, the AJAX pages could simply point to the mobile version of the page in question, which uses HTML only and is thus crawlable.</p>

    @Peter Keane: if that JavaScript was delivered the server in question, then there's no violation of URI opacity, nor of HATEOAS, and the situation is no different than if you were fabricating a URI from a URI template downloaded from the server. Still, it is, of course, better to have proper links if possible.
