        <blockquote><p>The CollabNet-sponsored Subversion project and The
            Apache Software Foundation (ASF) announced today that the
            award-winning Open Source project has formally submitted itself to
            the Apache Incubator in order to become part of the Foundation's
            efforts.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Does the ASF realize that subversion isn't written in Java?</p>
