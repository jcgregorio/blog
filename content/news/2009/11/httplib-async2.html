        <p>
        I've created a new mercurial repository in httplib2 called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/source/browse/?repo=async2">async2</a>.
        The goal is to address issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=5">#5</a>,
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=25">#25</a>,
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=44">#44</a>
        and address these in a way that makes it possible
        to experiment with <a href=http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/spdy/spdy-whitepaper>SPDY</a>
        in httplib2, which would be difficult if not impossible with the
        current blocking IO implementation.  The very rough goal is to create,
        or creatively reuse, a non-blocking async version of httplib, and then
        have httplib2 choose between the blocking or non-blocking version based
        on how the library is used.
