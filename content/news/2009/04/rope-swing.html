A simple rope tied to a tree over a stream can still provide
endless fun for kids. This spot in our neighborhood's greenway
had over a dozen kids filter through it in the half hour that 
I spent there with Reilly and Caden. Caden didn't attempt the rope
swing, but she did cross the stream multiple times using the fallen tree.
