        <p><a href=http://al3x.net/2009/07/18/fever-and-the-future-of-feed-readers.html>Alex Payne has an 
            interesting article on feed readers entitled: "Fever and the Future of Feed Readers"</a>
        which is well worth a read. </p>
        <p>It got me thinking about my subscriptions and how they've changed
        over time. Recently I've found myself cutting subscriptions and am now down 
        to less than 50, and of those, 25 are for
        'things' and not people; monitoring the health
        of some of my systems, the children's school, Tae Kwon Do school,
        etc.  The more interesting part to me is that after filtering
        them down several times I refined the criteria for feeds
        I would put in my 'people' grouping on Google Reader to
        technical people that I respect, but ones that don't blog too much, and
        not ones I will hear about anyway. They have to sit in a middle ground.
        For example, it appears that anything written by Steve Yegge or Joel Spolsky
        will become so wildly popular that I have no chance of missing it, no matter
        how hard I try. With them it's redundant to have them in my subscription list.
        On the other end of the spectrum there are people that post too 
        infrequently, who I have to scratch my head and try to remember who they
        are and why I was subscribed to their feed in the first place. Out they go.
        From the group that survives I also throw out anyone I already 
        follow on <a href=http://friendfeed.com/>FriendFeed</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>Contrast this with the days when my subscription list would
        regularly peak at 200 and I would have to trim it back. 
        </p>
        <p>How has your feed reading changed over time?</p>
