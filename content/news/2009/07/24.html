        <p>Lynne and I have been watching old seasons
        of 24 on DVD, a guilty pleasure at best, I kept getting this
        feeling that I'd seen this series before, but I couldn't quite
        figure it out, until I realized that 24 is Star Trek:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jack Bauer is Captain Kirk</li>
            <li>Chloe is Spock</li>
            <li>CTU is the enterprise</li>
            <li>Jack always leads the away missions.</li>
            <li>The Federal Government is the Federation</li>
            <li>Chloe can fix anything by reversing a matrix filter, just 
            like any problem could be solved on Star Trek by reversing the 
            transmitter array.
            </li>
        </ul>
