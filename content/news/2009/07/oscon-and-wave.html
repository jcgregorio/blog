        <p>I will be at OSCON next week giving a tutorial on Monday
        <a href=http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/7974>on Google App Engine</a>
        and will also be attending 
        the <a href=http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-wave-hackathon-and-federation.html>Google Wave Hackathon and Federation Days</a> on Monday
        and Tuesday.  Wednesday I'll be back at OSCON roaming the halls and spending some time
        staffing the Google booth. See you there!
        </p>
        <p>Remember that thing about me <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/431/wave-first-thoughts">not working on Wave</a>? 
        That's changed.</p>
        <p>
        On a tangential note, I won't be doing my <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/428/the-lack-of-design-patterns-in-python-pycon-2009>Design Patterns</a> talk that I did at PyCon, but
        it <a href=http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/7754>looks like the subject material will still be covered</a>. Maybe I shouldn't have
        put "Python" in my proposal title?
