        <p>Remember how some people at the Rocky Mountain News, unable
        to <a href=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/>think the unthinkable</a>, raced out to start an online news
        publication, believing they could get 50,000 paid subscribers?
        They did as well as could be expected, <a href=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2009/04/indenver_times_the_official_re.php>only signing up 3,000
            subscribers by their self-imposed deadline</a>. 
        One tidbit that I hadn't picked up the last time I read about the Rocky was
        that back in February of this year they had just purchased and got running
        their <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_News#Redesign>brand new $65 million printing press.</a>
