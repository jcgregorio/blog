        <p><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/opinion/14rich.html>Frank Rich in the New York Times nails the current rise in violence and hate-filled 
            rhetoric</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote><p>When a Fox News anchor, reacting to his own network’s
            surging e-mail traffic, warns urgently on-camera of a rise in
            hate-filled, “amped up” Americans who are “taking the extra step
            and getting the gun out,” maybe we should listen. He has better
            sources in that underground than most.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>What he reported was this: his e-mail from viewers had “become
            more and more frightening” in recent months, dating back to the
            election season. From Wednesday alone, he “could read a hundred”
            messages spewing “hate that’s not based in fact,” much of it about
            Barack Obama and some of it sharing the museum gunman’s canard that
            the president was not a naturally born citizen. These are Americans
            “out there in a scary place,” Smith said.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He later gets to one, but not the only, cause of the problem:
        </p>
        <blockquote><p>A sizable minority of Americans is irrationally fearful
            of the fast-moving generational, cultural and racial turnover Obama
            embodies — indeed, of the 21st century itself.</p></blockquote>
