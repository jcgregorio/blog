    <p>Welcome to my new publishing system, <a href=http://code.google.com/p/piccolo-pub/>piccolo-pub</a>.
    This is just a simple script the runs over the files that makes up this site
    and produces the final HTML output. This means that all the content is now 
    static HTML and serves very fast. It also means that for the short-term
    comments will be disabled. 
    </p>

    <p>I am considering adding an on-the-glass commenting system, like Disqus or js-kit. If you
    have any experience with such systems please let me know in the <del>comments...</del>
