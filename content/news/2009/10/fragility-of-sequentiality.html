        <blockquote><p>No, no, they're not. What's the difference between a bug
            and a variation or an imperfection? If you think about it, if you
            make a small change to a program, it can result in an enormous
            change in what the program does. If nature worked that way, the
            universe would crash all the time. </p></blockquote> 
        <p>Besides sounding like a plot device for a Douglas Adams book, it's a great point.

        <p>I've said it before: I sometimes feel like we're missing a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform>LaPlace
            transform</a> for programming.  </p>
