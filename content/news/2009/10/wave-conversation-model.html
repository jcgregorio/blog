        <blockquote><p>
         We've also been
working to provide more documentation around the wave model, and so we've
produced a draft specification for the wave conversation model...
            </p></blockquote>
            <p>
            While Wave in general allows editing any sort of XML-like structure, the 
            <a href=http://www.waveprotocol.org/draft-protocol-specs/wave-conversation-model>Wave Conversation Model</a>
            describes the vocabulary that Wave uses to represent conversations, those things you
            actually interact with via the browser.
            As usual, please direct all feedback to the <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/wave-protocol>mailing list</a>.
