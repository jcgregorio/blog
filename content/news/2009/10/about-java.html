        <blockquote><p>
            Ryan Tomayko’s I like Unicorn because it’s Unix should be required
            reading for anyone doing anything involving networks or unixes
            these days. Like Ryan, I share a deep appreciation for the dark art
            of Unix system calls, and like Ryan I’m a bit dismayed to see them
            relegated to the dusty corners of our shiny dynamic languages. 
            </p><p>
            So I read I like Unicorn because it’s Unix with glee; it’s perhaps
            the cleanest, clearest explanation of how preforking socket servers
            work, and I enjoyed seeing Ruby’s twist on the old
            standard.</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>I don't think IronPython should support multiprocessing, personally.
            While there are a few things within it that probably make sense
            (managers and the like) does it really make a ton of sense to run
            multiple iron python VMs from a single parent?
            </p><p>
            The same applies (in the case of multiprocessing) to Jython - a single
            JVM forking multiple JVMs doesn't necessarily make sense when you have
            perfectly functional threads.</p></blockquote>
