        <p><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/health/policy/01health.html>Health Bill Clears Hurdle and Hints at Consensus</a>:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Democrats also agree that Congress should create some
            type of government insurance plan or nonprofit cooperative, which
            would compete with private insurers. Mr. Obama says the public plan
            would keep insurers honest, but Republicans say it could eventually
            drive private insurers from the market, leaving consumers with
            fewer choices.</p></blockquote> 
        <p>First, there's this thing where insurance companies are under the mistaken assumption
        that they are <em>owed</em> a business model. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly,
        the Republican position relies on the absurd assumption the consumers actually 
        have a choice today in health insurance. Seriously? For almost all of us the choice is
        to pick the provider our employer uses or go without health insurance. How is that a choice?
