        Of all the things that the internet enables, I think one of 
        most interesting is new currency. Traditionally the purview
        of nation-states, I'm not sure what the rise of new currency means. 
        Fundamentally money <em>is</em> a signal, so something important is going on here.

            Bartering is an excellent way to expand your business. BBE will refer customers to you. The barter dollars you earn on these referrals can be used to purchase basic cash expenses, reducing the cash flowing out of your business each month.
