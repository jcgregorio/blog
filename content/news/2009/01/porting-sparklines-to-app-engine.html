  <p>
        The title of this article is actually misleading
        as the code isn't ported, but altered to run on both
        App Engine and under CGI. App Engine exposes a CGI 
        environment that your requests run under, so the real
        challenge comes from the differences in the runtime
        environment.
        </p>
<h3>Imaging</h3>
<p>
        The first big difference is that <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> (the Python Imaging
        Library) isn't available on App Engine, and it's not possible
        to add C extensions to your App Engine project, so we will have to find
        a pure Python substitute. Such a substitute exists in
        <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Projects/PNGCanvas">pngcanvas</a>, a pure Python module for creating PNG images.
        </p>
<p>
        My use of pngcanvas is actually the completion of a virtuous circle: 
        I originally created the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">Python sparklines service</a> and
        <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/sparklinesForMinimalists.html">why wanted to create one in Ruby</a> 
        using pure Ruby and BMPs, then that was the jumping off point for some commenters to
        do the same for PNGs, which led 
        <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2005/09/17/pure-ruby-sparklines">mir.aculo.us</a> to create 
        a library for creating sparkline PNGs in pure Ruby, which 
        <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Projects/PNGCanvas">Rui Carmo then ported to Python</a>, 
        which I will now use in porting the original sparklines code to App Engine.
        Small world.
        </p>
<p>
        Now you probably won't want to use pngcanvas for 
        extensive graphics manipulation, but since sparklines
        are small it will be just fine.
        As a side note, I really like the simplicity of the
        pngcanvas interface, the port actually resulted in removing
        lines of code compared to PIL, which is always a good sign.
        </p>
<p>
        The one problem that arises in moving from PIL to pngcanvas
        is the lack of color names. PIL allows you to specify
        colors by name, something pngcanvas doesn't support.
        Luckily X11 includes a convenient list of color names
        and their equivalent in RGB triples (<code>/etc/X11/rgb.txt</code>)
        which just needs to be converted into a form usable for
        Python. I could write code to import <code>rgb.txt</code> via Python, but
        since I have to upload the file to App Engine anyway, I'll 
        exercise the macro capabilities of my text editor and
        covert it into a Python file:
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">_colors = {
"snow": (255, 250, 250, 255),
"ghost white": (248, 248, 255, 255),
"ghostwhite": (248, 248, 255, 255),
# ...
"light green": (144, 238, 144, 255),
"lightgreen": (144, 238, 144, 255)
}
def colors(name):
    name = name.strip().lower()
    if name in _colors:
        return _colors[name]
    else:
        return (0, 0, 0, 255)</pre>
<p>
        Now I can use <code>rgb.py</code> to covert color names into RGB triples, 
        or in this case RGBA tuples like <code>pngcanvas</code> expects. 
        </p>
<h3>App.yaml</h3>
<p>
        If we wanted to do the absolute minimum then
        that would be all the changes we would need to make.
        The only extra step needed for App Engine is to describe
        the files we are using and their location so it knows
        what to upload and how to direct requests, which is done
        through the <code>app.yaml</code> file.
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">application: sparklines-bitworking
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: /
  static_files: index.html
  upload: index.html
- url: /spark.js
  static_files: spark.js 
  upload: spark.js 
- url: /spark.cgi?.*
  script: spark.py
</pre>
<p>
        And were done. But there are some other changes we can make
        to take full advantage of the App Engine platform.
        </p>
<h3>The <code>main()</code> optimization</h3>
<p>
        If your handler script exports a <code>main()</code> function
        that takes no arguments then App Engine will keep the script
        cached and call <code>main()</code> for subsequent requests. 
        Skipping the evaluation of the script on each
        request improves performance, so we'll break out the code into two modules,
        <code>main.py</code> which will be our script handler
        and <code>script.py</code> which will contain
        all of the sparkline drawing logic.
        That change is now reflected in our <code>app.yaml</code>
        file:
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">application: sparklines-bitworking
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: /
  static_files: index.html
  upload: index.html
- url: /spark.js
  static_files: spark.js 
  upload: spark.js 
- url: /spark.cgi?.*
  script: main.py
        </pre>
<p>And the <code>main.py</code> is very simple:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">from spark import plot
def main():
    plot()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()  </pre>
<h3>Memcache</h3>
<p>
        Now the original sparklines code already made good use
        HTTP caching by setting <code>ETag:</code> and <code>Cache-control:</code> headers, but
        we can do more under App Engine by using the memcache service.
        After drawing each sparkline we can store the PNG in 
        memcache using a hash of the incoming request query 
        parameters and the application version as the key 
        and subsequently look for images in memcache when 
        requests come in using that same hash. If there is a hit we can avoid 
        doing any drawing at all.
        We still want to be able to use the code on a
        system that doesn't have memcache support so
        we will make its use conditional.
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">try:
    from google.appengine.api import memcache
except:
    memcache = None
</pre>
<p>Check for memcached images:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def plot():
    plot_types = {
        'discrete': plot_sparkline_discrete, 
        'impulse': lambda data, args: plot_sparkline_discrete(data, args, True), 
        'smooth': plot_sparkline_smooth,
        'error': plot_error
    }
    if not os.environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] in ['GET', 'HEAD']:
        error("Status: 405 Method Not Allowed")
    if_none_match = os.environ.get('HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH', '')
    hashkey = entity_hash()
    if if_none_match and hashkey == if_none_match:
        not_modified()
    <b>if memcache:
        image_data = memcache.get(hashkey)
        if image_data is not None:
            ok()
            sys.stdout.write(image_data)
            sys.exit()</b>
    form = cgi.FieldStorage()
    # ...
    </pre>
<p>Populate memcache with images after drawing them:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    # ...
    image_data = plot_types[type](data, args)
    <b>if memcache:
        memcache.add(hashkey, image_data)</b>
    # ... 
    </pre>
<p>
    By making the use of memcache conditional on its presence
    this code can now be used both on App Engine and also on my 
    server which doesn't have memcache.
