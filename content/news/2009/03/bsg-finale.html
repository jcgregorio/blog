 (<small>IPA</small>: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA" title="Wikipedia:IPA">[ˈdeɪʌs ɛks ˈmakʰɪna]</a></span> literally "god
from the machine") A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device" title="Plot device">plot
    device</a> in which a surprising or unexpected event occurs in a story's
plot, often to resolve flaws or tie up loose ends in the narrative. Neoclassical literary criticism, from Corneille and John Dennis on, took it as
a given that one mark of a bad play was the sudden invocation of extraordinary
circumstance. Thus, the term "<i>deus ex machina</i>" has come to mean any
inferior plot device that expeditiously solves the conflict of a narrative.

    Correct definition, but incorrectly applied!  In BSG, the finale ending was telegraphed from the very beginning -- in fact, from the very first series in 1978!  While the details were definitely new and surprising, overall it was a very expected ending, I believe.  And an excellent one!  I especially like the ambiguous definition of "God" (he doesn't like being called that!) at the very end...
