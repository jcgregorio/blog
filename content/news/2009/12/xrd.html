        <td><p>This document defines XRD, a simple generic format for
          describing resources. Resource descriptor documents provide
          machine-readable information about resources (resource metadata) for
          the purpose of promoting interoperability, and assist in interacting
          with unknown resources that support known interfaces.</p>
          <p>
          For example, a web page about an upcoming meeting can provide in its descriptor
          document the location of the meeting organizer's free/busy information to
          potentially negotiate a different time. The descriptor for a social network
          profile page can identify the location of the user's address book as well as
          accounts on other sites. A web service implementing an API protocol can
          advertise which of the protocol's optional components are supported.</p>

          The World Wide Web was originally built for human consumption, and although
          everything on it is machine-readable, this data is not machine-understandable.
          It is very hard to automate anything on the Web, and because of the volume of
          information the Web contains, it is not possible to manage it manually. The
          solution proposed here is to use metadata to describe the data contained on the
          Web. Metadata is "data about data" (for example, a library catalog is metadata,
          since it describes publications) or specifically in the context of this
          specification "data describing Web resources". The distinction between "data"
          and "metadata" is not an absolute one; it is a distinction created primarily by
          a particular application, and many times the same resource will be interpreted
          in both ways simultaneously.  </p>
          <p>
          Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a foundation for processing metadata;
          it provides interoperability between applications that exchange
          machine-understandable information on the Web. RDF emphasizes facilities to
          enable automated processing of Web resources. RDF can be used in a variety of
          application areas; for example: in resource discovery to provide better search
          engine capabilities, in cataloging for describing the content and content
          relationships available at a particular Web site, page, or digital library, by
          intelligent software agents to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange, in
          content rating, in describing collections of pages that represent a single
          logical "document", for describing intellectual property rights of Web pages,
          and for expressing the privacy preferences of a user as well as the privacy
          policies of a Web site. RDF with digital signatures will be key to building the
          "Web of Trust" for electronic commerce, collaboration, and other applications.

    <p>I draw the comparison not to point out that XRD should be RDF, but
    to point out that regardless of the serialization, XRD, RDF, or N3, it's not
    the solution that's problematic, it's the problem statement to begin with.
    It's like asking the question, "How to do you build a ladder from here to the moon?"
    and then having a furious argument over what color to paint it.
