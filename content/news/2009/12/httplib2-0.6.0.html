    <p>Version 0.6.0 of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a> has been released today.</p>
    <p>
    The following issues have been addressed:
    </p>

   <pre>    #51 - Failure to handle server legitimately closing connection before request body is fully sent	
    #77 - Duplicated caching test	 
    #65 - Transform _normalize_headers into a method of Http class
    #45 - Vary header	  
    #73 - All files in Mercurial are executable	 
    #81 - Have a useful .hgignore	 	 
    #78 - Add release tags to the Mercurial repository		 
    #67 - HEAD requests cause next request to be retried	  
   </pre>

   <p>
   Mostly a bug fix release, the big enhancement is the addition of proper Vary: header
   handling. Thanks to Chris Dent for that change.
   </p>
   <p>
   The other big change is the build process for distributions so that both python2 and python3
   are included in the same .tar.gz/.zip file. You can 
   peek at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/source/browse/Makefile">Makefile</a> to 
   see the hacky way that I accomplished that. Suggestions on better ways to 
   accomplish the same thing are welcome.
   </p>
