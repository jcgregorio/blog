      <a href=http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/source/browse/spec/rst2rfc.py>rst2rfc</a> - Because making humans edit XML is sadistic.
    </p>

    <p>
    Rst2rfc.py is a command-line tool written in Python that uses <a href=http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>docutils</a> and converts
    ReStructuredText input into XML suitable for consumption by <a href=http://xml.resource.org/>xml2rfc</a>.
    Currently the code lives as a part of the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/>wave-protocol project</a>, but if
      you have issues please report them via the issue tracker on <a href=http://code.google.com/p/rst2rfc/>http://code.google.com/p/rst2rfc/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code, as of today, is not robust. Actually, at the slightest
      provocation it will halt and burst into flames.
      Much of that is because it doesn't generate the end output
      directly, instead taking in ReStructuredText input and 
      producing <code>xml2rfc</code> compatible output, which is then processed
      via <code>xml2rfc</code> to produce the final <code>.txt</code> output.
      This allows me to use both the txt and html generation capabilities of
      xml2rfc.  Modifying rst2rfc to directly produce the final <code>.txt</code> 
      would be nice. See the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/source/browse/spec/conversation/Makefile>Makefile</a>
      for how it's called, and the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/source/browse/spec/conversation/convspec.rst>Google
        Wave Conversation Model source document</a> for what the input
      looks like.

      I will be continuing work on this as a matter of need, with the Google Wave Federation Protocol
      being converted to ReST next, and other Wave documents soon to follow.
