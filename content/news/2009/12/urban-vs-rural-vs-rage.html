    <blockquote><p>
       So take right now, for example, there is a right-wing populist uprising.
       It's very common, even on the left, to just ridicule them, but that's
       not the right reaction. If you look at those people and listen to them
       on talk radio, these are people with real grievances. I listen to talk
       radio a lot and it's kind of interesting. If you can sort of suspend
       your knowledge of the world and just enter into the world of the people
       who are calling in, you can understand them. I've never seen a study,
       but my sense is that these are people who feel really aggrieved. These
       people think, "I've done everything right all my life, I'm a god-fearing
       Christian, I'm white, I'm male, I've worked hard, and I carry a gun. I
       do everything I'm supposed to do. And I'm getting shafted." And in fact
       they are getting shafted. For 30 years their wages have stagnated or
       declined, the social conditions have worsened, the children are going
       crazy, there are no schools, there's nothing, so somebody must be doing
       something to them, and they want to know who it is. Well Rush Limbaugh
       has answered - it's the rich liberals who own the banks and run the
       government, and of course run the media, and they don't care about
       youâ€”they just want to give everything away to illegal immigrants and
       gays and communists and so on.</p>

     of the Wall Street Journal, reviewing the book "Hollowing out the Middle: The Rural Brain
     Drain and What It Means for America":</p>
     <blockquote><p>
       The middle of America, so long treated with mirth, mockery and mawkish
       condescension by coastal smarties, is shrinking. "The Heartland's most valuable
       export," write husband and wife sociologists Patrick J. Carr and Maria J.
       Kefalas, is not "crops or hogs but its educated young people." This migration
       has devastating effects. From North Dakota to upstate New York, a youthful
       exodus is "hollowing out many of the nation's small towns and rural
       communities."
       </p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p>
       Mr. Carr and Ms. Kefalas adeptly frame the encounters of Ellis high-school
       grads with the wider world, capturing the profound alienation experienced by
       many small-town kids at college. The authors are on shakier ground discussing
       Ellis itself. You cannot drop into a town for a year and come away with deep
       understandings. Their claim that "there is probably no other place in American
       society where the rules of class and status play out with a more brutal
       efficiency than in the world of a country high school" is so howlingly
       inaccurate that only displaced urban academics could believe it.

     Gotta blame somebody, it's not like the population has been 
     slowly shifting from rural to urban for the past 100 years:</p>
