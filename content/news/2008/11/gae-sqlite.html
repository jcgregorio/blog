<a href="http://blog.appenginefan.com/2008/10/gql-queries-in-sql-part-4.html">Last month</a>, I wrote I would not post the sql connector's source code until it was a little more functional. Guess what? I changed my mind: you can find all the code at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gae-sqlite/">http://code.google.com/p/gae-sqlite/</a>.

<p>From the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gae-sqlite/">code.google.com project page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a module that will allow you to run Google's App Engine development server with an SQLite backend. The concept is intended to be generic enough that other databases (mysql, SQL Server, Oracle...) can follow with only minimal modifications.</p></blockquote>

    I was just asking Josh Staiger about this the other day, when he was over for lunch, if you guys already had this.  He didn't know.  I think this may be an important part of the "(hand wave) this is not the locked-in cloud story you are afraid of" message for GOOG.  Perhaps not technically, but just for completeness.
