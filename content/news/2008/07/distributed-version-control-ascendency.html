<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/07/09/Which-Tools">Tim</a> points to a <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=Vng7MOwBeNpnJhv3392wadMvjE6rl8lq8Kcu95Q5Cig_3d">
survey of bug tracking and source code management
tool preferences</a>. The surprise to me is that the three <b>distributed</b>
version control system have garnered more than 60% of the votes.
Would that have been even conceivable a year or two ago?

    It is illuminating to notice that the top 60% of bug tracking systems are shared between three of the worst such systems on the planet. All just happen to be free, and popular in the open source community because there's really nothing better out there at the moment.
