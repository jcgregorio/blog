  <p>Being a parent has it's ups and downs.</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Up</dt>
<dd>Three of the four children at a sleep-over.</dd>
<dt>Down</dt>
<dd>A midnight call because someone can't sleep without a very specific stuffed animal. Luckily 
    it's a short walk to the neighbor's house.</dd>
<dt>Up</dt>
<dd>All three make it through the night, which is a first for one of them.</dd>
<dt>Down</dt>
<dd>The eight year old throwing up that morning because, shockingly, you cannot 
    subsist on gatorade and popcorn for dinner and then only get five hours of sleep.</dd>
<dt>Up</dt>
<dd>At least it wasn't the stomach flu.</dd>
