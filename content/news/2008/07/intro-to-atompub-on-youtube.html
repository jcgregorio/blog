    Hi Joe,
This was relaly useful, thanks. I'm just getting to grips with these technologies and short tutorials like this are great.

Question, when you say media I think of video and audio. However does what you said about media apply to other binary formats such as .docs, .pdfs etc.... ? I'm assuming we would treat those in exactly the same way and there is no differentiation between those and what you termed "media".

cheers
Jamie

    Jamie,<br />
<p>You are correct, "media" refers to anything that isn't an Atom Entry, such as .docs, .pdfs, etc.

    Thanks Joe, that was a great overview.  One question though- starting at 3:19, you show a slide showing an atom entry that was POSTed to the collection, and highlight the edit URI assigned, in this case http://example.org/edit/2/.  In the next slide, you said that in order to delete the entry, one would send an HTTP DELETE to the edit URI, but the slide shows DELETE http://example.org/feed/2/.  The noted the same discrepancy in the "update" slides.  Was this just a mistake in the slides, or is there something I'm missing?  I watched these sections three times, and I can't figure out what I'm missing.

    <p>Nope, you're right, those are typos on my part, sorry.</p>
