  Well another OSCON has come and gone, a total 
  blur of mind bending hallway conversations with an occasional
  session thrown in. This year I ran into a lot of people
  I haven't seen in years, and as usual met many more.
  While 2008 may not go down in history as the 
  Year of the Linux Desktop, I believe in the open source
  world it will go down as the year of the toddler. 
  It seemed like every other person I talked to had a small child
  at home and had kid pictures; the unrepentant had them
  on their iPhones, the rest of us stuck to old-fashioned pieces of paper.

  I gave two presentations and the I've added the slides
  for them to my <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/">
  projects page</a>, which actually puts you in a better
  position than the attendees of one of my talks; due to 
  various technical hiccups the audience never
  saw my slides. Huge thanks to my co-presenter Zaheda Bhorat
  who covered with an improptu talk while we fiddled with VGA
  cables.

  If you look at the foot traffic to all the 
  data storage presentatations
  and announcements like <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/07/23/drizzle/">Drizzle</a> and 
  <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a>, you can 
  certainly see that <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData">
   MegaData</a> is on the march, but 
  these are very early days; we are years away
  from having the "MySQL of MegaData", but not only are
  there people trying to build such an animal today, there
  is also a growing segment of the programming population
  that's eager to put such a beast to work.
