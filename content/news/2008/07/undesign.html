  <p>If you haven't visited my site recently, I've redesigned, or undesigned
  as the case may be, stripping out as much as I could, dropping 
  background images, etc, following in the minimalism of <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/06/21/minimalism">Mark</a> 
  and <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris">Ryan</a>,
  though I doubt I'll ever get around to setting a Baseline. And removing administrative debris
  is easy since I don't have any, controlling my blog is all done via the Atom Publishing Protocol.
  Now that I've cleared the underbrush I'll start in on <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/06/24/Minimalist-Markup">Sam's version of minimalism</a>.

    Thanks Sam, forewarned is forearmed.

    I like it a lot.

One suggestion: please add rel=next/prev links. I've just started using these in Conkeror (http://conkeror.org), and they are super-handy!

Using the Name field as a spam check is a great idea; hope you don't mind if I end up stealing it for my site when I get around to it.

    Your copyright year (in the footer) appears to be wrong---unless of course, they are applied to only until 2007 :).
