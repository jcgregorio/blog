  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol Buffers</a> have been <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/07/protocol-buffers-googles-data.html">open sourced</a>.
They're one of the first things you learn about when you start at Google and they're used
everywhere. The release supports C++, Java and Python, but <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2387105.html">Brad is working on Perl support</a>.

    What's the reason for lack of PEP8 compliance for the Python support?

    <p>Google has their own coding style guide for Python which doesn't always line up with PEP8.</p>

    Liz,<br />
<p>There are lots of data serialization technologies out there, each with their
  pros and cons, each suited to different contexts, and I've never even heard or HDF before now, so any comparison I would provide would be downright useless.
