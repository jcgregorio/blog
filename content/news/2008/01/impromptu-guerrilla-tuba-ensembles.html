  <p>I was talking to <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark</a> when he pointed out <a href="http://www.tubanews.com/index.php">TubaNews</a> to me. An entire site dedicated to the Tuba. It's the Internet, so of course something like that exists. I hypothesized that given what I know about the Internet, and the normal mechanics of communities of passion, that there was probably a competing tuba site that we didn't know about, a competitor to TubaNews, one that came about because of some rift in the community. Maybe there was a disagreement about proper mouth-piece usage, or cleaning and polishing techniques. Regardless the differences were irreconcilable and led a faction to split off and start their own tuba site. You know it would happen. Anyway, I let my imagination get away from me and I envisioned both groups concentrated in NYC, antagonistic, flash-mobbing outside the apartments of the oppositions member's apartments in impromptu guerrilla tuba ensembles. </p> <p>Man, would I love to make a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> about that.</p>

    The link to TubaNews is broken: you're linking to tub<b>E</b>news.com instead.

    I wish that there was decent video of this -- http://downtownmusic.net/pictures/picturesrhtml/Anthony_Braxton/show.0/default.htm#thumb

Anthony Braxton's piece for 100 tubas, played in NY in Jun of 06.

Youtube has http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfXpEXyOdWg but it's pretty useless as a representation of the piece. Plus, there's none of the Jets vs Sharks quality that you want...

    Got me interested enough to find the web site of my son's occaisonal tuba instructor <a href="http://www.tonytuba.com/">http://www.tonytuba.com</a> , who is (thank goodness!) <a href="http://www.tubanews.com/profiles/profile-Tuba-130.html">listed in TubaNews</a>.  He seems to be a popular tuba instructor in our area, if anyone's looking.

    On a continuing tangential note, I believe the sluggish Sousaphone hero sales are partially due to the popularity of the more competitively priced (read: free) <a href="http://www.vml.com/handbellhero/">Handbell Hero</a>. Though it is a seasonal item so look for Sousaphone Hero 2 to explode onto the market this spring?!
