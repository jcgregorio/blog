  <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/28/iraq.afghanistan">The Guardian:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Appetites whetted, Stiglitz and Bilmes dug deeper, and what they have discovered, after months of chasing often deliberately obscured accounts, is that in fact Bush's Iraqi adventure will cost America - just America - a conservatively estimated $3 trillion. The rest of the world, including Britain, will probably account for about the same amount again.</p></blockquote> <p>Yes, you too can create you own failed-state-terrorist-haven with nothing more than a lie and $3,000,000,000,000.</p>
