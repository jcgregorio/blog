  <p>The kids have been spending hours playing with Phun:</p> <embed height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0H5g9VS0ENM&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed> <p>The more I play with it, and watch them interact with it, the more I wonder why     more user interfaces don't include physics. </p>

    <p>So that's how they built stone henge!</p>
<p>It's truly <em>marvelous</em> that so much of the knowledge of mechanics can be so quickly represented and displayed.  It will be such a great future to see a society where fully-working, three-dimensional machines can be designed in such a way as Phun.  And then combine this with a three-dimensional printer ... limitless possibilities for making machines and models!</p>
