<p>
  I have been absent for the majority of the past three weeks due to various
  family medical issues. Everyone is OK now and I'm back to work. Part of the
  time I was out was because I had surgery, a septoplasty and turbinate
  reduction. Let me tell you about that surgery.
</p>
<p>Oh, if you are squeamish you should stop reading now.</p>
<p>Really, just stop now.</p>
<p>You've been warned.</p>
<p>
  Septoplasty is surgery to go in and straighten out or repair the septum, the
  piece of cartilage that runs down the middle of the nose. It appears that
  early in my life my septum slid off to one side of the bone it's supposed to
  be resting on. I didn't think cartilage was afforded that kind of mobility,
  but apparently mine was. My doctor later explained with a disturbing amount of
  glee that the cartilage was "pretty messed up in there".
</p>
<p>
  If I wasn't born with a deviated septum then it deviated when I was very
  young, as I've had some trouble breathing through my nose as long as I can
  remember, and had no idea what 'normal' breathing was like. I would frequently
  hear people with colds complain that they couldn't sleep because their nose
  was stuffed up and they could only breath through their mouth. I always found
  that kind of baffling as I never breathed through my nose while I slept, I
  simply didn't have enough air flow. Breathing through my nose as I slept was
  as plausible as breathing through my ears.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, as I've gotten older the situation has gotten worse and I finally
  decided to get it fixed, and two Mondays ago I went in for surgery. Now, I was
  told to expect one full week to recover and ..., well, let's look at what
  <a
    href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/repair-of-a-deviated-septum-septoplasty-what-to-expect-after-surgery"
    >WebMD</a
  >
  has to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    After surgery, you may have a nasal splint or pack placed in your nostrils
    to stop bleeding and keep the septum straight while it heals.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The use of the term 'splint' doesn't really do them justice. Splint is such a
  small dainty word that I don't think it accurately reflects what happens. Here
  I've rewritten that description to better reflect reality:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    After surgery, you may have canoe paddles shoved into your nostrils to stop
    bleeding and keep the septum straight while it heals.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  You have no idea how deep your sinus cavity is. It is apparently deep enough
  that you can have four inch long pieces of plastic shoved into them well past
  the nostrils and then sown into place.
</p>
<p>And left there.</p>
<p>For a week.</p>
<p>
  This, as you might imagine, is not comfortable. Not actually painful, mind
  you, but there is something about having canoe paddles touching the back of my
  sinus cavity, pressing up against the bottom of, oh, what should be there, let
  me remember, oh yeah, <b>my brain</b>, that rendered me completely incapable
  of rational thought. Yes, I was on Oxycodone for the first week, but even
  after I stopped taking them on Friday them I was still addled until the
  splints were removed the following Monday. During my recovery I received my
  copy of Slide:ology, among other books, but I read it first since it had the
  largest amount of white space and the prettiest pictures. Well, I tried to
  read it during my short wakeful periods. Occasionally I would stop and take a
  break and when I picked the book back up just for fun I would go back and read
  back a page from where I stopped. The last page I'd read, you'd think I'd
  remember it. Nope. It was all brand new. Now that I'm fully recovered I look
  forward to reading it again and actually retaining something this time.
</p>
<p>
  Lynne was a great help and endured my being addled with aplomb. At one point
  we were having a conversation and it seemed vaguely familiar. "Have we had
  this conversation before?" "Several times," she responded.
</p>
<p>
  Now, this is real surgery, and there is real blood involved, and one of things
  you need to do is have some gauze taped under your nose to catch the blood
  before it drips out onto your shirt. This is what I refer to as the 'nose
  diaper'. I've included a handy drawing of the proper way to prepare such a
  'nose diaper' to help you, should you decide to have this surgery. This is
  probably different than what you will be shown at the hospital, as my nurse
  rolled up two or more sheets of gauze and taped the resulting thick ball
  wadding under my nose, which is both uncomfortable and almost completely
  ineffective for various hydrodynamic reasons I won't bother to explain.
</p>

<p>
  The thoughtful reader at this point will note that there are two exits from
  the nose, the first out the front and the second down the back of your throat.
  There's no nose diaper you can construct for the flow of blood that exits that
  way. That explains the second prescription that I was given for the surgery:
  Promethazine, an anti-nausea medicine.
</p>
<p>
  For the first week my wakeful time was really small, only about 4 hours a day,
  usually in one hour windows where I would get a drink, eat a very small meal,
  take another Oxycodone and maybe a Promethazine, change the nose diaper and
  then go back to sleep. Over the course of that first week I lost five pounds.

<p>
  By the time I got to Thursday I was starting to feel a little better and tried
  to get up and move around the house some more, even going so far as to cook.
  This was a mistake, one for which I suffered four nose bleeds over the course
  of the evening, some of them involving a large amount of blood. I believe it
  was the third nose bleed when I was standing over the sink with blood running
  out my nose and out my mouth at the same time that I heard one of my family
  members remark, "Wow, that's more blood than on
  <a href="http://www.fox.com/fringe/">Fringe</a>."
</p>
<p>
  Based on all that blood on Thursday I went in for a checkup on Friday and one
  of the doctors 'cleaned out' my nose and the splints, which it turns out were
  hollow and I was supposed to be able to breath through them. He started off
  this process by taking two Q-Tips, dipping them into water or maybe
  hydrogen-peroxide and then shoving them down into the splints to 'loosen
  things up'. I will not lie, even with the Oxccodone and local anesthetic he
  gave me, that hurt. He then proceeded to use a suction nozzle to suck 'stuff'
  out of my nose. To be clear, blood tends to do that clotting thing and those
  clots have been hanging out in the newly renovated jungle-gym that was my
  nasal cavity for a week. I had a grim moment of pride when the small suction
  nozzle became clogged and the doctor had to switch to the large suction
  nozzle. That too became clogged but he was able to use it to drag out very
  large and colorful 'things', some of which were over a foot long.
</p>

<p>
  The Monday following the surgery I went in to have the splints removed, which
  was a trememdous relief.
</p>
<p>
  Remember the old coffee stirrers they used to have, the ones that look like
  two tiny straws glued together. When I was a kid we'd get those and try to use
  them as straws, and you had to work real hard to get any soda through them.
  Now imagine if someone switched out that straw while you weren't looking and
  you took another sip out of that now-normal sized straw. You'd suck too hard
  and a get a huge rush of soda in your mouth. That was exact thing I
  experienced repeatedly in the fifteen minutes after the splints were removed.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Breathe. "Whoa, Big Straw!"</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Breathe. "Whoa, Big Straw!"</p></blockquote>
<p>
  But after only 15 minutes I was breathing normally through my nose. And by
  normal I mean normal as in apparently most-humans-breathe-this-way normal.
</p>
<p>
  After just one or two nights I was breathing through my nose when I slept, I
  expected it to take longer to unlearn forty years of habit.
</p>
<p>
  My sense of smell is returning, but sporadically. Two weeks out from the
  surgery I can smell most things if I put them up close to my nose and it is
  improving a little every day. There are, however, weird periods where my sense
  of smell goes into overdrive and my nose picks out one thing to smell. For
  example, earlier this week I walked out into the back yard and was struck by
  the overwhelming smell of some charred wood in the chimenea 20 feet away. A
  minute or two later it passed and I could barely smell the charred wood when I
  put my head right up to the little fire place. I have had those super-smell
  moments two or three times a day after the splints were removed, sometimes to
  the most disgusting of odors, but they seem to be decreasing in frequency as
  my normal sense of smell returns.
</p>
<p>
  All in all it was a totally miserable experience, but the end result is well
  worth it.

  Get well soon, Joe! The Wife had one about a year ago. In the end, it paid
  off. But I was painful, both for her, her mother and me.

    Sorry to hear about your ordeal Joe, but glad to hear the situation is
    improving and hopefully this will make a real positive difference over the
    course of your life!

  I think you've got our sympathy. Part way through I was getting ready to tell
  my story of pain involving several of my teeth, but by the end I think, no,
  yours was more grim.

  I had a similar surgery myself some years ago. I was so dulled with pain at
  the time that I only remembered later how much pain I was in. I had to sleep
  sitting up for almost a month. But again, it has mostly been worth it - when I
  have a cold now, at least one nostril is clear ;)

  Joe, I went through something similar a few years back. In my case, one of the
  turbinates had an air-bubble in it (called a 'concha bulosa) that was causing
  poor drainage leading to various chronic upper-respiratory infections,
  including in my tonsils (which is what I originally had decided to finally get
  taken care of). This had also caused some deviation of my septum, but no real
  blockage (except when I had a cold). The various xrays taken also determined
  that the turbinate was also growing a bone-spur sideways and would in a few
  years start causing some *major* problems. The solution was to basically
  remove the turbinate. This involved the same kind of splints, though in my
  case they needed to use the XXL size ones due to the large schnozz (and skull)
  I inherited. They also discovered quite a few 'interesting' things trapped in
  my sinus cavity that had been blocked in by the turbinate and were in the
  process of calcifying. Suffice it to say that they decided to roto-rooter them
  out since they were already up in there. The splints (even though XXL) didn't
  press on my brain and affect cognition much, but the pressure-relief from the
  roto-rootering (and later again from the splint *removal*) did. I had
  more-or-less the same experience for removal of the splints. The footlong
  'very large and colorful things' were in my case the artificial-skin-like
  packing material they had sprayed rather liberally in there. After the splint
  removal I had to go back several times to have them pull out ginormous
  rock-hard clots (some approximately 3/4" in diameter) that kept forming and
  blocking my nasal cavity, and eventually to have them remove the last
  stitches. Still, like you, it was worth it, as the throat and tonsil
  infections have nearly completely abated in the years since, though I now have
  to use a saline spray semi-regularly to keep things moist up in there (that
  being one of the functions of the turbinate).

  Okay - I have a question! I had septoplasy/turbinate reduction about two weeks
  ago. My nose is starting to recover, however I have been having unbelievable
  tooth pain. All of my teeth hurt severely. I went back to the surgeon
  yesterday. It was explained to me that it has to do with the nerves. And also
  that I had an abnormal amount of inflammation and swelling. He prescribed
  steroids. They seem to maybe be working! I am concerned about nerve damage.
  Has anyone else had this specific experience with this surgury?

    Wow, I had totally forgotten about the tooth pain, I would get random
    pin-pricks of pain across my teeth for a minute and then it would subside,
    but it went away after the first two days. Good luck with your recovery.
