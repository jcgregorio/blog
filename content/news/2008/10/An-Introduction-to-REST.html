  <p>Can you explain REST in under 15 minutes? I gave it a try:</p>

    <p>Very nice explanation indeed, Joe. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I should have tried to fully understand what REST represents some time ago, but always forgot to research, your video is a nice starting point.</p>
<p>Now I'm heading to the "Further Reading" items. :)</p>

    Great explanation, this will be a worthwhile post to link to for those needing a better understanding of the benefits of REST.

    Thanks!
And, why was PUT and DELETE left out from browsers?

    Anton: HTTP/1.0 didn't include PUT and DELETE, and browsers were first built with HTTP/1.0 in mind. And then they simply didn't add PUT and DELETE when they implemented the other features of HTTP/1.1, as they probably didn't realize the usefulness of those actions.
