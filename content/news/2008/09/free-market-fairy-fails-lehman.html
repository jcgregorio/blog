  <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601170&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=abVpg8xJDMWk">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the biggest reshaping of the financial industry since the Great Depression,
 two of Wall Street's most storied firms, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc., headed toward extinction.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The phrase "since the Great Depression" is just classic,
you know, since all of this started when 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/289/The-Free-Market-Fairy">Free Market Fairy</a> believers of all stripes decided to
lift, what were they called again, oh yeah, "Depression-era regulations"
on banks and investment firms. The whole thing was spearheaded by Phil Gramm, 
<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/the-gramm-connection/">passed by a Republican 
congress and signed into law by Bill Clinton</a>. The rest of the article 
is what typically passes for journalism these days, 
an "oh gosh, how did this happen?" piece, when the outcome was
as inevitable as a brickwall across a highway.

    I'm sort of flabbergasted by the "no one saw this coming" angle. For the last several years, Paul Krugman wrote a New York Times column at least once a month about how a train wreck was inevitable.
<br /><br />
Of course at the time he was labeled "shrill" and "alarmist".

    i'm not sure i grok the idea of your Free Market Fairy in this case. shouldn't businesses be free to fail in a free market? isn't that what happened? is there a reason you never post anything on the failure of government to regulate 'just right?' or how regulatory capture impedes fair competition? a sense a bit of a confirmation bias in your own reporting. (i'm not free of it myself.)

    unacoder: yes, but I presume they shouldn't take the whole industry down with them?
