  <p>Wow, <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/358/restful-json">that</a> kicked off a great discussion around RESTful JSON with 
lots of comments and blog posts from 
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/08/19/wave-of-mutilation-i-mean-standardization/">Robert Sayre</a>, 
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/08/19/Standardizing-RESTful-JSON">Sam Ruby</a>, 
<a href="http://www.json.com/2008/08/19/standardizing-restful-json/">Kris Zyp</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.aminus.org/blogs/index.php/2008/08/19/restful-json?blog=2">Robert Brewer</a>.
</p>
<p>The one thing I've learned is that my blog comment system is 
<strong>not</strong> the place to have a long threaded discussion.
That kind of discussion really belongs on a mailing list so I've created
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/restful-json">[restful-json]</a>.
