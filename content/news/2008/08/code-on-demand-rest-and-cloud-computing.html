<blockquote><p>A key test of whether an API is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the API provider...</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/07/open-source-and-cloud-computing.html#comment-563431">
   Kevin Marks points out that the definition is too weak</a>, a point which Tim concedes.
</p>
<p>Regardless, one aspect of REST that gets frequently overlooked 
  is Code on Demand. From <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_5_3">Roy's Thesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the code-on-demand style, a client component has access to a set of resources, but
not the know-how on how to process them. It sends a request to a remote server for the
code representing that know-how, receives that code, and executes it locally.</p></blockquote>
<p>
 The word 'code' here means JavaScript. Well, at the time it was written all the examples
 given were Java applets, but the idea is the same, that code is downloaded and executed.
 The takeaway here is that JavaScript is a fully fledged RESTful part of the web, and those JavaScript
 APIs, <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/354/the-role-of-REST-in-cloud-computing">just like the
 hyptertext I pointed out yesterday</a>, are RESTful points of integration of Cloud Computing.
</p>
<p>It's almost as if the web were designed for this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> As Roy pointed out in the comments, his thesis
  contains a whole section describing 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_4_3">why JavaScript is more RESTful
  than Java applets</a>.

    Did you mean all of the examples in that section were of Java? It should be noted that I devoted an entire section to describing <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_4_3">why JavaScript is more RESTful than Java applets</a>.  I still think it is amusing that, six years later, people started referring to AJAX as a new thing.

    Roy,<br />
<p>Yes, I meant that all of the examples in that section were of Java. I should have included a link to that latter section also. Thanks!</p>
