  <p>Just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Robot-Army-Defending/dp/1596912812/">How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies</a>.
   This book was really good, not quite fiction, not quite serious manual 
   on robotics, it's a quick little read that could get a kid interested 
   in robotics. The only downside is the three page chapter on 'fem-bots' 
   where the author let's his chauvinism show through; cut out the reference 
   to Love Dolls and you'd have a five star book.

  The other book that came in at the same time,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doodles-Really-Giant-Coloring-Doodling/dp/0811852504/">Doodles: A Really Giant Coloring and Doodling Book</a>, is just hands down fantastic.
  The unfinished pictures come with instructions, from the very simple
  - 'color in the snakes'  except the snakes stretch over three pages of the book - to
  'draw what these birds have just picked up'. What pretends to be 
  a coloring book pushes you to be creative, imaginative, and whimsical.
  We chose to have one bird fly off with an elephant while the other
  made away with a volkswagen bug. I'm not sure who's enjoying the book
  more, me or the kids.
