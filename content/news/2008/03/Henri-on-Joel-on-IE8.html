  <p>Of all the responses to Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">tortured pantomime of impartiality</a>, <a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/rdf/">Henri's is the best</a>, and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/03/18/translation-from-ms-speak-to-english-of-selected-portions-of-joel-spolskys-martin-headsets">Mark's is the funniest</a>.</p>

    General Manager for the Internet Explorer team explained that IE8 will still also render pages in an IE7 compatibility mode but that this mode will not be the default as they had previously announced. The decision to enable this mode will be left up to the developer of the website being visited, using an http header/meta tag.
