  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/06/activities-and-webslices-in-internet-explorer-8.aspx">IEBlog</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Under the hood, an Activity uses a simple XML format called OpenService. Just implement an XML file that describes how your service works with URL templates.</p></blockquote> <p>URL Template? Is that like a <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">UR<strong>I</strong> Template</a>?</p> <p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc304163(VS.85).aspx#_urlTemp">OpenService Format Specification for Activities</a></p> <blockquote> <p>All variables are treated as required unless it [sic] the modifier "?"</p></blockquote> <p>Rats, those aren't <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI Templates</a>. But thanks for picking a different name. </p> <p>Just for a little context, when discussing URI Templates the use of the trailing '?' was considered for marking a template variable optional, but in the end that was considered metadata and could appear in the surrounding document, just like it could appear the OpenService Format. </p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: URIs have a very limited character set. What happens if I have a URL Template that contains {selection} and I happen to select "&#x2604;"?</p>

    No, but they are based on the OpenSearch templates.  They acknowledge that somewhere else...
