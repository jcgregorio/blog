  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/feedvalidator/wiki/AppClientTest">AppClientTest</a> has been updated again. Every warning or error generated now contains a link to the section of the specification that is being violated. I also have incorporated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Mike Samuel's Javascript Code Prettifier</a> so that all the XML requests and responses are easier to read. Finally, the request method and URI are also present in the report for every request. Here is an <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestsuite/client/test.html">example report</a> if you want to see these enhancements in action.</p>

    Joe, the link to the Javascript Code Prettifier seems to be wrong.  Currently, it points to the AppClientTest, but shouldn't it point http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ instead?
