  <p>I'm not following HTML5, so this was <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/04/html5-foreign">pleasantly surprising news</a>:</p> <blockquote><p> The last few weeks there has substantive discussion on the HTML WG mailing list (public-html) and the Math WG public dicussion mailing list (www-math) regarding embedding non-HTML languages in the text/html serialization of HTML focusing mostly on MathML and SVG. </p></blockquote> <p> It will be nice when the majority of the web has access to both SVG and MathML. </p>

I used SVG a lot on <a href="http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/tarot/">an art project in 2002</a>. I had to rely on Adobe's SVG Viewer plug-in to display it, and the Mozilla browser family managed to render itself incompatible with the plug-in just as Adobe felt they could stop working on it. It's taken them about five years to catch up, in which time Adobe has failed to promote the SVG plug-in and it has fallen in to disuse, leaving my graphics stranded. Even now, I need to do a major overhaul of the SVG code because Mozilla and Safari implement SVG viewports differently from Adobe. Sigh.

The discussion about getting MathML and SVG in to HTML 5 is interesting because they seem to be seriously tackling the issues of compatibility and how SVG and HTML fit together that the XHTML community likes to pretend have already been solved by magical XML.
