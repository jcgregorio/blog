  Yesterday we <a href="http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/06/atompub-multipart-media-creation.html">
  announced</a> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gregorio-atompub-multipart-00.txt">
  draft-gregorio-atompub-multipart-00</a>. By "we" I mean Google, and by "announced" I mean that
  the internet-draft got published last month and I finally got around to writing a blog post this week.
  As usual the discussion should take place on the <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/">atom-protocol</a> mailing list. 
</p>
<p>One thing I didn't mention in the announcement is that the 
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/atompub-mulitpart-spec/">source
  for the draft</a> is hosted on <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code Project Hosting</a>.
  Not only does that give me Subversion, and the ability to host files 
  (<a href="http://atompub-mulitpart-spec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-gregorio-atompub-multipart-00.html">
  like the HTML version of the spec</a>), but also the Issue Tracker which I will use to track open issues
  with the spec.

    At least you didn't spell Google wrong... the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/yhoomediaplayer/">yhoomediaplayer</a> folks probably kicked themselves just as hard. :)
