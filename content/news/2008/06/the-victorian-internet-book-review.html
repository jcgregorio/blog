  <p>I missed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victorian-Internet-Tom-Standage/dp/0425171698/">this book</a> when it was first published, but picked it
up recently and was really impressed. While the title
would have you believe it was focused on the internet, in actuality
only the last chapter discusses the parallels between
the telegraph and the internet, while the remainder of the book
is actually a well written history of the telegraph, which 
bodes well for the endurance of this book; instead of coloring
the whole book with the perspective of the internet as it 
exists today, it is left as a straight-forward history that 
will probably take on fresh meanings and perspectives
as the internet grows and our relationship to it evolves.

Things I learned:
</p>
<p>The first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was
   laid in 1866, a 2,300 mile long cable just a few inches wide,
   which is a stunning achievement for the time.
</p>
<p>
The Associated Press was formed as a response to the
disruptive innovation of the telegraph, which is ironic
given it's <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/324/the-associated-press-shoots-itself-in-the-internet-foot">ham-fisted attempts at dealing with
another disruptive innovation</a>.
</p>
<p>
The telegraph had the equivalent of domain names; telegraphic addresses (short names)
were sold to companies that senders could use
to address their telegrams to, thus making the telegram
shorter and cost less to send, and yes, you had to pay an annual
fee to keep your telegraphic address.
