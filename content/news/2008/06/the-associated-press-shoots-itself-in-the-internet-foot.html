  <p>Clueless corporate member of mainstream media fails
  to grasp internet; cuts nose off to spite face; film at eleven.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ap.org/FOI/index.html">Associated Press</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Associated Press is the bastion of the people's right
to know around the world. With a long history of involvement
in FOI issues and actions, AP is an industry leader in
"open government issues."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless, of course, you're one of those <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2008/06/ap-seeks-to-define-fair-use-fo.html">dirty hippie bloggers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The scope of AP's efforts worldwide is extraordinary. Whether
reporting on Iraqi prisoner abuse or the difficulty in getting aid to
tsunami victims, AP captures the consequences of government action or
inaction.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/17/associated-press-exp.html">Just don't quote us on that</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
At the state level, AP open government efforts are coordinated by the
chief of bureau, working in conjunction with state members, FOI
councils, industry associations and other interested groups.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
   And the DMCA, don't forget the DMCA, <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/associated-press-v-drudge-retort">
   we like the DMCA too</a>!
</p>
<p>
  Are you left wondering about their motivations
  for doing this? Well, here's a little background, the AP is a not-for-profit cooperative was founded in 1846 
  and is owned by 1,500 US daily newspaper members, not that I would ever suggest that US daily newspapers
  have an axe to grind against the internet and bloggers. Never.

    It should all be resolved quickly, as <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/06/16/apObjectsToQuotingandlinki.html">Dave Winer</a> is now on the case.  I'm sure that <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/">Rogers</a> will appreciate the help.
