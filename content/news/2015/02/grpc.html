  Today Google launched <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, a new HTTP/2 and
  Protocol Buffer based system for building APIs. This is Google&#39;s third
  system for web APIs.
</p>
<p>
  The first system was Google Data, which was based on the
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5023.txt"
    >Atom Publishing Protocol [RFC 5023]</a
  >. It was an XML protocol over HTTP. The serving system for that grew, but
  started to hit scalability issues at around 50 APIs. The scaling issues
  weren&#39;t in the realm of serving QPS, but more in the management of that
  many APIs, such as rolling out new features across all APIs and all clients.
</p>
<p>
  Those growing pains and lessons learned led to the next generation of APIs
  that launched in 2010. In addition to writing a whole new serving
  infrastructure to make launching APIs easier, it was also a time to shed XML
  and build the protocol on JSON. This Google I/O video contains good overview
  of the system:

  Now, five years later, a third generation API system has been developed, and
  the team took the opportunity to make another leap, moving to HTTP/2 and
  Protocol Buffers. This is the first web API system from Google that I
  haven&#39;t been involved in, but I&#39;m glad to see them continuing to push
  the envelope on web APIs.
