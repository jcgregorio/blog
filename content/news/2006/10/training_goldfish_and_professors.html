<p>Yes, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/10/02/digg">training Goldfish</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGw6EhBtznM">on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of a story my undergraduate philosophy 
  professor told me. 
  </p>
<p>
  She was taking a psychology class
  with a professor that really liked his students to take 
  notes. He also liked to pace in front of the blackboard 
  when he lectured. After finishing the section 
  on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov">Pavlov</a>
  the class got together and decided to only take notes
  when the professor was in front of the left side of the blackboard.
  After a week he was only pacing there.
  So the next week they cut the left hand side
  in half and did it again. And again.
  They kept cutting his pacing space in
  half and in a month had him firmly 
  planted on the left hand side of the blackboard.
  </p>
<p>
  Oddly enough, when they finally told him what they'd done
  he wasn't very happy.
