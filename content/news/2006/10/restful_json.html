<p>
  As I pointed out in <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/JSON_isnt_XML">
  JSON isn't XML</a> REST doesn't just apply to XML formats and that it's possible to use
  JSON RESTfully and not just in the <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">old patterns</a>. 
  </p>

  
<p>
  Theory is nice, but working code is nicer. 
  So let's walk through building a RESTful service using JSON.
  In this case we are going to be building a cookbook, 
  modeled as a collection ala the Atom Publishing Protocol.
  </p>
<p>
  A Collection is nothing more than an encapsulation of 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD_(acronym)">CRUD</a>.
  That's why the concept is so powerful
  and you see lots of folks doing non-blog
  stuff with the APP. In this case we want to have a collection
  but not use Atom, instead we want to manipulate 
  a list of member resources, whose members 
  we can manipulate with GET/PUT/DELETE and 
  have JSON representations.
  </p>
<pre>
  Collection
     href     -&gt;   Member Resource
     href     -&gt;   Member Resource
     href     -&gt;   Member Resource
</pre>
<p>
  Let's build a <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/How_to_create_a_REST_Protocol">familiar looking table</a> for what our
  collection looks like:
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="20">
<tr> <th>Resource</th> <th>Method</th> <th>Representation</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
<tr><td>Collection</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON</td> <td>Get a list of members in the collection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Collection</td> <td>POST</td> <td>JSON</td> <td>Create a new member of the collection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Member</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON</td> <td>Get a member. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Member</td> <td>PUT</td> <td>JSON</td> <td>Update a member.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Member</td> <td>DELETE</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>Delete a member. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  We can leave the actual form on the member representations
  up to each implementation, but we should give a standard form
  for the collection document. We could just use an array of 
  URIs:
</p>
<pre><code>[
  "http://example.org/coll/1",
  "http://example.org/coll/2",
  "http://example.org/coll/3",
  ...
  "http://example.org/coll/N",
]
</code></pre>
<p>
  But that causes two problems. The first is that the collection could be huge and you
  might not even want to get all the URIs. We need the equivalent of 
  the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-11.html#rfc.section.10.1">
    Atom Publishing Protocol's link relation of "next"</a> and some place to store it.
  The second problem is extensibility, there's no place to store my own extensions in the collection document.
  </p>
<p>
  So let's take our list and put it in an object, giving us space for 
  our "next" link:
  </p>
<pre><code>{ 
  "members":
  [
    "http://example.org/coll/1",
    "http://example.org/coll/2",
    "http://example.org/coll/3",
    ...
    "http://example.org/coll/N",
  ],
  "next": "http://example/coll/page/2"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The only other thing we need is some place for extensiblity
  in the list of members, so let's turn each of those into objects
  also:
</p>
<pre><code>{ 
  "members":
  [
    { "href": "http://example.org/coll/1" },
    { "href": "http://example.org/coll/2" },
    { "href": "http://example.org/coll/3" },
      ....
    { "href": "http://example.org/coll/N" },
  ],
  "next": "http://example/coll?page=2"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  We can also reduce some verbosity if we allow relative URIs in "href". For
  example, if the URI of this collection document is <tt>http://example.org/coll/</tt>
  then we get:
</p>
<pre><code>{ 
    "members":
    [
      { "href": "1" },
      { "href": "2" },
      { "href": "3" },
        ....
      { "href": "N" },
    ],
    "next": "http://example/coll?page=2"
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
  That looks good. Now what would this look like on the wire?
  Let's say we wanted expose an interface to our cookbook. 
  The cookbook will be a collection and each member will be a recipe.
  We'll take a very simplistic representation for our recipe
  for now:
</p>
<pre><code>{
  "title": "the name of the recipe",
  "instruction": "the recipe instructions"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example GET to the collection:</p>
<pre><code>GET /coll/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
User-Agent: NotGiven/1.0
Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>
<p>
And the response may be:
</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Wed, 20 Sep 2006 17:17:11 GMT
Content-Length: nnn
Content-Type: application/json

{  
  "members": 
  [
    {"href": "chicken"}, 
    {"href": "ribs"}, 
    {"href": "burger"}, 
    {"href": "pizza"}
  ],
  "next": null
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Now to retrieve the first member of the collection:
</p>
<pre><code>GET /coll/chicken HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
User-Agent: NotGiven/1.0
Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>
<p>
And the response may be:
</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Wed, 20 Sep 2006 17:18:11 GMT
Content-Length: nnn
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "title": "Southern Fried Chicken", 
    "instruction": "First get a chicken..."
}
</code></pre>
<p>
To update our recipe we PUT an updated JSON representation back the same URI:
</p>
<pre><code>PUT /coll/chicken HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
User-Agent: NotGiven/1.0
Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
Content-length: nnn 
Content-type: application/json

{
  "title": "Southern Fried Chicken", 
  "instruction": "First gather the ingredients: 
    a whole chicken, 
    one quart of buttermilk..."
}
</code></pre>
<p>
And the response may be:
</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Wed, 20 Sep 2006 17:18:12 GMT
Content-Length: 0 
</code></pre>
<p>
DELETE is used on the member to remove it from the
collection, and we POST a JSON representation to the
URI of the collection to create a new entry:
</p>
<pre><code>POST /coll HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
User-Agent: anonymous/2.0
Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA==
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: nnn

{
  "title": "Trout on a stick",
  "instruction": "First get a trout and a stick..."
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The server signals a successful creation with a status code of 201
and the response includes a "Location" header indicating the 
URI of the newly created member.
</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 2006 17:17:11 GMT
Content-Length: nnn
Content-Type: application/json
Location: http://example.org/coll/trout
</code></pre>
<p>
   That seems like a good start, next we'll build a <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/restful_json_server">server-side implementation</a>.
</p>
