 I think there's room for some more standards building on WSGI (that 
 aren't actually extensions of the WSGI spec itself).
 </p>
<p>
 I put a page up on the wsgi.org site for this: 
 <a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications">http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications</a>
</p>
<p>
 And I'm introducing what I think is low-hanging fruit in the 
 specification realm: wsgi.url_vars 
 <a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/url_vars">http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/url_vars</a>
</p>

<p>It <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2006-October/002287.html">appears</a> that 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/">wsgicollection</a> was part
   of the motivation, which is gratifying.
 </p>
<p>I have updated <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/">wsgicollection</a>
   to support <code>wsgi.url_vars</code> in addition to the currently
   supported <code>selector.vars</code>.
