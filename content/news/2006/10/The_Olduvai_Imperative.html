When I see the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/10/30.html">very cool things Jon Udell has done
with my sparklines code</a> I simultaneously feel
elated and frustrated. Elated that someone can do cool
stuff and possibly make a difference using code I wrote. Frustrated that
our tools today are so crude that it takes very specialized
knowledge to blend all these technologies together. 
The ability to create those graphs needs to
be in the hands of everyone, not just those of us
practiced in a very narrow set of arcana. When I think of 
the hurldes to that I think of  <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/moores-law-is-crap.html">Steve Yegge's rant</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
You have no idea the pain I feel when I sit down to program. I'm
walking on razor blades and broken glass. You have no idea the contempt I feel
for C++, for J2EE, for your favorite XML parser, for the pathetic junk we're
using to perform computations today. There are a few diamonds in the rough, a
few glimmers of beauty here and there, but most of what I feel is simply
indescribable nausea.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And the title of this post? The Olduvai Impertive
is the name given to the human need to make and use tools.
