<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20061023/cm_huffpost/032164">Richard Dawkins</a>:
My scientific colleagues have additional reasons to declare emergency. Ignorant
and absolutist attacks on stem cell research are just the tip of an iceberg.
What we have here is nothing less than a global assault on rationality, and the
Enlightenment values that inspired the founding of this first and greatest of
secular republics. Science education - and hence the whole future of science in
this country - is under threat. Temporarily beaten back in a Pennsylvania court,
the 'breathtaking inanity' (Judge John Jones's immortal phrase) of 'intelligent
design' continually flares up in local bush-fires. Dowsing them is a
time-consuming but important responsibility, and scientists are finally being
jolted out of their complacency. For years they quietly got on with their
science, lamentably underestimating the creationists who, being neither
competent nor interested in science, attended to the serious political business
of subverting local school boards. Scientists, and intellectuals generally, are
now waking up to the threat from the American Taliban.
