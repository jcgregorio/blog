<a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166">Tim Berners-Lee has announced</a> the chartering of a 
    completely new HTML Working Group. This is huge news; a complete 
    departure from the "HTML is dead, XHTML is the only thing we are working on"
    stance of the past few years. There are quite a few people including those
    participating in the WHAT WG that deserve a good deal of credit
    for putting the ship back on course and
    Tim gives them the credit they are due. Admitting you were wrong
    and a willingness to change course is great example, and far too rare
    in today's hard-liner "Stay-The-Course" world.
