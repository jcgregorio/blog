These past six years were more than just the most shameful, corrupt and
incompetent period in the history of the American legislative branch. These were
the years when the U.S. parliament became a historical punch line, a political
obscenity on par with the court of Nero or Caligula -- a stable of thieves and
perverts who committed crimes rolling out of bed in the morning and did their
very best to turn the mighty American empire into a debt-laden, despotic
backwater, a Burkina Faso with cable.
