  <p>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/02/20/Mr-Safe">syndication wars</a>
   have <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/20/Mr-Safe">re-erupted</a>, like
   a recurring rash for which there's no cure. The
   only difference from the last time this occured 
   is that now everyone has a blog, including journalists,
   and unsurprisingly the most shrill and
   vacuous post in the whole debate is from <i title="and I use the term loosely">journalist</i>
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/?p=222">Steve Gillmor</a>.
</p>
<p> 
  Maybe the difference between a blogger and a journalist isn't that
  journalists <i>have</i> editors, but that they <b>need</b> them.
