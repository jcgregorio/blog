  <p>The <a href="http://dev.lucene-ws.net/wiki/API">Lucene Web Service API</a> is based on the Atom Publishing Protocol.</p>
<blockquote><p>The core of Lucene Web Service API is primarily based on the Atom Publishing Protocol, with a few extensions. We've added the ability to get and set properties of any index or the service itself. For searching, we've based our implementation on the OpenSearch 1.1 protocol. The contents section of an Atom Entry sent to or received from the web service is based on the XOXO Microformat.
</p></blockquote>
<p>APP, OpenSearch and Microformats. Get used to seeing them; those small 
  pieces loosely joined are the future of web services.
