  <p>Because I can't be the only one trying
to configure the EDIMAX DSL Modem Router to work
with Bellsouth FastAccess ADSL, here is the 
configuration I finally found that works.
Note that the following is a list of things
that you need to change from the default
configuration:</p>
<pre><code>
Virtual Circuit:  Enabled
Bridge:           Disabled
IGMP:             Disabled
Encapsulation:    PPPoE LLC

VPI:              8
VCI:              35
Service Category: UBR

DHCP:             Disabled	
MAC Spoofing:     Disabled

Advanced ADSL Configuration
---------------------------

Handshake Protocol: G.dmt
</code></pre>
