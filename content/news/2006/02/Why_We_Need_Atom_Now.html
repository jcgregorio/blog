  <p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/21/Why-We-Need-Atom">Why We Need Atom Now</a>, from 
  Tim Bray, points to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313441">bugzilla bug #313441</a>, 
  which you just have to check out. There's nothing like cutting open the problems of RSS and laying them out 
  like the entrails of a dissected frog for the world to see.
