title: Httplib2 Version 0.1.1

  <p>I have just released version 0.1.1 
   of <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a>.
</p>
<p>This release fixes several bugs raised by 
   <a href="http://and.org">Jim Antill</a> and
   adds support for Python 2.3 thanks to Xavier Verges Farrero.
   In addition it is now sporting a standard distutils
   based setup. Distutils is pretty sweet as it integrates
   directly into the <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi">cheeseshop</a>.
   To build my release packages I just type:
</p>
<pre><code>$ python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip</code></pre>
<p>And to update the info on the cheeseshop I type:</p>
<pre><code>$ python setup.py register</code></pre>
<p>I will be setting up a bug tracking system and 
   mailing list soon. Any suggestions are welcome, 
   except for "Just use SourceForge", because SF is slow,
   <del>hasn't rolled out subversion to the general community
   yet</del>, it's slow, and did I mention it's slow?
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Apparently SourceForge is the worst possible choice, except
  for everything else, and that's why I'm eating crow and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/httplib2">
  hosting httplib2 there</a>.
</p>
