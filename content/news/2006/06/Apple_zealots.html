Mark Pilgrim, noted long-time Apple fan, has recently switched to Linux which has <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks#comments">predictably earned him the ire of the Apple zealots</a>. With 90+ venom filled comments, and counting, there's enough material for an entire Ph.D. thesis in cult-like behavior tied up in that thread.

BTW, just upgraded the laptop to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Dapper (aka 6.06 LTS)</a> and it works like a charm, and no, this is not a dual-boot: Linux is the only operating system installed.
