<p><strong>Update (July 8):</strong> A huge thank you to everyone that has emailed, phoned,
   or linked to me over the past several weeks. Your offers of warm wishes, contracts,
   referrals, advice, and employment are greatly appreciated. 
   I was contacted by really great people at a huge number of companies that
   are doing a whole range of cool things and that made it all the harder to 
   decide when to stop the search and accept an offer. But that's what
   I've done and I am very excited to tell you that yesterday I accepted a 
   position at IBM. My first day is the 25<sup>th</sup>, which gives me two
   weeks to really relax and catch up on those projects around the house. More
   details about the group I'm in and the project I'm working on will
   have to wait until after I start and find out what I'm allowed to talk about.
  </p>

  As of 10 O'Clock this morning I am no longer employed; being laid off tends
  to do that to you. The good news is that I can catch up on all those
  projects around the house, my backlog of <a href="http://xml.com/pub/at/34">XML.com</a> articles, my editing
  of the <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05433.html">next
  draft of the Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, etc. I can even start
  blogging about the industry I was working in and the company I was working for, 
  but only after I fulfill the requirements of my severance package.

  As positive as that all sounds I do have a mortgage and a family, and they like
  to eat, so I need to find gainful employment.
