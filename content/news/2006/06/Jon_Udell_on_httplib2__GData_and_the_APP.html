  <p>A very nice writeup on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/06/13.html#a1468">
   httplib2, GData and the Atom Publishing Protocol by Jon Udell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> The hero of the piece is <a href="http://bitworking.org/">Joe Gregorio</a>, whose wonderful <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/03/18.html#a1408">Sparkline service</a> I highlighted a while back. Joe is also, and rather more notably, the author of both the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-08.txt">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> and Python's <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a> library, two projects that came together to facilitate my transfer of calendar data (see script below).

<p><b>*Blush*</b>. While <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/RESTLog_Overview">I have been 
  pushing for a RESTful publishing protocol 
  for close to four years</a>, I am an <i>editor</i> of the APP, which is really the result 
  of a collaboration of a large group of very talented people in the 
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Atompub Working Group</a>.
