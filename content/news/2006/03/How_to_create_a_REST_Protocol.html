   <p>If you follow web services, then you may have heard
		of REST. REST is an architectural style that can be
		used to guide the construction of web
		services. Recently, there have been attempts to create
		such services that have met with mixed success.  This
		article outlines a series of steps you can follow in
		creating your protocol--guidance that will help you
		get all the benefits that REST has to offer, while
		avoiding common pitfalls.
		</p>
<h3>What Is REST?</h3>
<p>What is REST anyway? It is an architectural style.
		An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of
		architectural constraints.</p>
<blockquote><p>A software architecture is defined by a
			configuration of architectural
			elements--components, connectors, and
			data--constrained in their relationships in
			order to achieve a desired set of
			architectural properties.  [<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Efielding/pubs/dissertation/software_arch.htm#sec_1_2">Roy
			Fielding</a>]</p></blockquote>
<h3>Why Follow REST?</h3>
<p>
		The whys of REST are covered on the <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage">REST
		Wiki</a>.  There are advantages to be had, from
		scalability, to simplifying implementation, to
		increasing the ability for your service to be reused.
		Jon Udell has two great articles, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/03/17/udell.html">
		The Beauty of REST</a> and <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html">
		Tangled in Threads: The power of the URL-line</a>, that
		cover the benefits of a 'composable' system.
		</p>
<p>Look at it this way: if you're using the
		infrastructure of the web to move your data around,
		shouldn't you follow the best practices that will help
		your data move more smoothly through the system? It's
		better to go with the flow than to try to swim up
		stream.</p>
<h3>How to Create a RESTful Interface</h3>
<p>Now we get to the meat of the matter. Instead of
			covering this from an architectural view, I'll
			approach it from a recipe perspective, a
			series of steps you take and questions you
			can answer, that will hopefully guide you to
			creating a great REST interface.
		</p>
<p>To create a REST service, you need to answer the following
		questions, and you should answer them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the URIs? </li>
<li>What's the format? </li>
<li>What methods are supported at each URI? </li>
<li>What status codes could be returned?</li>
</ol>
<p>In laying out these questions, I didn't use the
		proper naming conventions; instead, I used the common
		names for things that most developers are familiar
		with. As we answer each question, I'll also introduce
		the proper nomenclature.</p>
<h3>Question 1: What Are the URIs?</h3>
<p>The proper nomenclature would be "What are the
		resources?" The things identified by URIs are
		"resources." That is the terminology used in Roy
		Fielding's thesis and also the same terminology used
		in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#information-resource">
		Architecture of the World Wide Web, First
		Edition</a>. Resources are identified by URIs.
		</p>
<p>You might be creating a RPC protocol, or worse, if
		you only have a single URI that everything goes
		through. Many years ago, one of the first intranet
		services I put together was a web interface to an ECO
		(Engineering Change Order) system. Every time a part
		was changed, an ECO was filed and had to flow through
		this system. I created a single script that handled
		the whole system, a single script that took all it's
		parameters via POST. That meant there was no way to
		bookmark a page in the system; each page had the same
		URI: <code>/cgi-bin/eco.cgi</code>.  Employees wanted
		to bookmark certain ECOs or send shortcuts via email,
		but they couldn't because the URI in the address bar
		never changed. It was always the
		same, <code>/cgi-bin/eco.cgi</code>, unchanging, like
		the blinking 12:00 on an unprogrammed VCR.  The
		employees didn't know about REST, but what they did
		know implicitly is that each resource, in this case, an
		ECO, should have its own URI.
		</p>
<p>Break your problem down into the types of resources
		you want to manipulate. The thing to remember is that
		each resource should have its own URI. Try to list all
		the resources you could possibly need at this
		step. Two places to consider when looking for
		potential resources are collections and search
		interfaces.  A "collection of resources" may, in itself,
		be a whole new resource. </p>
<p>A search interface is another source of
		resources. You enter criteria for the resources you
		want to find, and a list of matching resources are
		returned. You may notice, though, that the results of a
		search are just a collection of resources, ones that
		match a particular criteria, and as such, this is
		really just a narrower version of the first case of a
		resource collection.
		</p>
<p>Consider a very simple example of a system for
		maintaining an employee contact list. For our example,
		it will contain each employees name, title, and
		contact information. In such a system, each user should
		have their own URI with an appropriate
		representation. That representation should contain the
		name, title, and contact information for that
		employee.</p>
<p>There is also a collection of resources that is, in
		   itself, another resource. The collection of all
		   employees is another resource in our system. So we
		   have identified two kinds of resources in this tiny
		   system, and so there will be two types of URIs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Employee (One URI per employee)</li>
<li>All Employees</li>
</ol>
<p>After you've identified the resources via their
		URIs, it's time to consider the next question.</p>
<h3>Question 2: What's the Format? </h3>
<p>The proper terminology here is "representation."
		You can't actually reach out and touch the resources
		behind the URIs you identified in Step 1. What you
		<em>can </em> do is exchange representations of those
		resources.  When I do a GET on an "employee" resource,
		I need to get something back which conveys information
		about that employee. These days HTML, XML, images,
		sound, and movies are all potential formats that could
		be used. For now, we'll restrict ourselves to using
		XML: it's a pretty popular format, lots of tools are
		available to process it, and there is an expectation
		that when you say "web services," you are referring
		primarily to the exchange of XML documents. And, yeah,
		this is being published on XML.com!
		</p>
<p>For each of the resources you listed in Step 1, you
		need to decide what the representations are going to
		look like. If possible, reuse existing formats if they
		are applicable. This can increase the chances that
		your system can be composed with other systems.
		</p>
<p>In our example employee contact list above, we could
		have the following representations:</p>
<dl>
<dt id="employee-format">Employee Format</dt>
<dd>For the sake of exposition, I will make up
			a new XML format for this information. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=exposition">Exposition</a>--"A statement or rhetorical discourse intended
			to give information about or an explanation of
			difficult material"--which just means that I
			get to cheat as long as you learn something in
			the process.
			</dd>
<dd><pre><code>&lt;employee xmlns='http://example.org/my-example-ns/'&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Full name goes here.&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Persons title goes here.&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;phone-number&gt;Phone number goes here.&lt;/phone-number&gt;

&lt;/employee&gt;</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt id="employee-list-format">Employee List Format</dt>
<dd>Since each employee will have his or her own 
			URI with all the details there, our list will only
			include that URI.</dd>
<dd><pre><code>&lt;employee-list xmlns='http://example.org/my-example-ns/'&gt;
    &lt;employee-ref href="URI of the first employee"/&gt;
	 Full name of the first employee goes here.&lt;/employee&gt;

    &lt;employee-ref href="URI of employee #2"/&gt;Full name&lt;/employee&gt;
    .
    .
    &lt;employee-ref href="URI of employee #N"/&gt;Full name&lt;/employee&gt;
&lt;/employee-list&gt;</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that we haven't mapped the representations to
		resources just yet.  To do that, we need to consider
		the methods.</p>
<h3>Question 3: What Methods Are Supported at Each URI?</h3>
<p>In the proper nomenclature, how do the URIs we
		defined in Step 1 get <em>dereferenced</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agents may use a URI to access the
			referenced resource; this is
			called <dfn>dereferencing the
			URI</dfn>. Access may take many forms,
			including retrieving a representation of the
			resource (for instance, by using HTTP GET or
			HEAD), adding or modifying a representation of
			the resource (for instance, by using HTTP POST
			or PUT, which in some cases may change the
			actual state of the resource if the submitted
			representations are interpreted as
			instructions to that end), and deleting some
			or all representations of the resource (for
			instance, by using HTTP DELETE, which in some
			cases may result in the deletion of the
			resource itself).  [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-uri">Architecture
			of the World Wide Web, First Edition</a>]
			</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll restrict the discussion to accessing
		resources using one the four basic HTTP methods that
		can be applied to a URI: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.  HEAD
		is really a GET without a response body, and there are
		also others defined by RFC 2616 like OPTIONS. In
		addition, specs like WebDAV introduce even more
		methods. That's nice, but you should be able to go
		very far with just the four basic methods, which align
		nicely with CRUD, an acronym from the database world
		which stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD.">Create,
		Retrieve, Update, and Delete</a>.
		</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr> <th>HTTP Method</th> <th>CRUD Action</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <td>POST</td> <td>CREATE</td> <td>Create a new resource</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>GET</td> <td>RETRIEVE</td> <td>Retrieve a representation of a resource</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>PUT</td> <td>UPDATE</td> <td>Update a resource</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>DELETE</td> <td>DELETE</td> <td>Delete a resource</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>I hesitated to include this table. By presenting it,
		I wanted to point out the overlap in the four basic
		methods of HTTP. What I <strong>don't</strong> want to
		happen is that you start thinking of web resources as
		SQL tables. Don't do that.
		</p>
<p>Make sure your GETs are side-effect free. This is a
		biggie, the one where many services get it wrong. GETs
		must be both <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1">
		safe</a> and
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2">
			idempotent</a>. In turn, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#state">
			anything which does not have side effects
			should use GET</a>.

		</p><p>So if you want to create a new resource, use
		POST. Want to retrieve a representation of a resource?
		Use GET. To update a current resource, use
		PUT. Finally, to delete a resource, use DELETE.
		</p>
<p>Once you have decided on the URIs (Step 1), picked
		representations (Step 2), and decided on methods (Step
		3), you need to match them all up.  At the very least,
		you'll need to pick a representation for the response
		of every GET and a representation to place in the
		request for PUT and POST. Optionally, you may want to
		consider the representation, if any is returned from
		a POST.
		</p>
<p>Let's go back to our employee contact list, and now
		we can match up the resources, the representations,
		and the methods.
		</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr> <th>Resource</th> <th>Method</th> <th>Representation</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>GET</td> <td>Employee Format</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>PUT</td> <td>Employee Format</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>DELETE</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>All Employees</td> <td>GET</td> <td>Employee List Format</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>All Employees</td> <td>POST</td> <td>Employee Format</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Question 4: What Status Codes Could Be Returned?</h3>
<p>Not only do you need to know what type of
		representation is returned, you also need to enumerate
		the typical HTTP status codes that could be
		returned. In a perfect world, this step wouldn't be
		necessary since a good implementation would handle
		every status code correctly. In practice, you should
		list all the status codes you expect to return. This
		will provide good guidance for implementers on the
		conditions they should be testing for.
		</p>
<p>We'll update our table for our employee contact
		   list to include the expected status codes</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr> <th>Resource</th> <th>Method</th> <th>Representation</th> <th>Status Codes</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>GET</td> <td>Employee Format</td> <td>200, 301, 410</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>PUT</td> <td>Employee Format</td> <td>200, 301, 400, 410</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Employee</td> <td>DELETE</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>200, 204</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>All Employees</td> <td>GET</td> <td>Employee List Format</td> <td>200, 301</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>All Employees</td> <td>POST</td> <td>Employee Format</td> <td>201, 400</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Warning Signs</h3>
<p>Even following these steps, you could still make
		some mistakes.  Paul Prescod has created a list of <a href="http://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes/">Common
		REST Mistakes</a> that is worth reviewing as you work
		on your protocol.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Let's review. To build a good REST service you need
		to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the URIs? </li>
<li>What's the format? </li>
<li>What methods are supported at each URI? </li>
<li>What status codes could be returned?</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's all there is to it. You don't believe
		me?  Good, because it's not true. There's lots more to
		discuss, like compression, etags, caching,
		extensibility, idioms, and implementations. See you
		next month.</p>
