  <p>My latest column for <a href="http://xml.com/pub/at/34">The RESTful Web</a>, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/03/29/httplib2-http-persistence-and-authentication.html">
  httplib2: HTTP Persistence and Authentication</a>,  is up on XML.com.
</p>
<p>In the article I cover HTTP compression, of which <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2">httplib2</a> supports both
  "compress" and "gzip". I remember reading that "deflate" was to be avoided
  but couldn't remember the reason. Walter Underwood wrote me to point out
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.compression/msg/e6bbe67658d97d96?hl=en">a post on google groups</a> 
  that explains the small set of compression algorithms that were interopable with browsers circa 2003.
  Remember that httplib2 is a client application and not a server so the types of 
  compressions that work on browsers is irrelavant, but it is interesting 
  to see issues that can arise.
