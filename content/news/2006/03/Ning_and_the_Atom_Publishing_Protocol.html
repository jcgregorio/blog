  <p><a href="ning.com">Ning</a> has 
  <a href="http://etech06.ning.com/">announced they are adding 
   support for the Atom Publishing Protocol</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>So that's dealt with getting data in, sharing data between apps - but what
about getting data out again? In the talk we proudly unveiled
<b><a href="http://documentation.ning.com/sections/atom.php">our new Atom API</a></b>
which lets you execute arbitrary queries against the Ning Content Store and
get the results as an Atom feed. 
This means that every app on Ning gets a web services API with full read
access <i>without having to add a single line of code</i>. Some of the queries
are really nifty, too - <a href="http://yoznewyorktrip.ning.com/xn/atom/1.0/application/children">here's
how we got the list of clones of my NY Trip app</a>. You can subscribe to that
feed and be notified every time someone makes a clone. As part of our Atom API
support we'll soon be rolling out write access too, using the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Atom Publishing
Protocol</a>.</p></blockquote>
