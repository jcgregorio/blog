  <p><a href="http://www.python.org">Python.org</a> gets a much needed facelift. It's not complete, for example
  <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/">wiki.python.org</a> and 
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/">docs.python.org</a> still have the old style, but
  what <i>has</i> been updated looks great. </p>
