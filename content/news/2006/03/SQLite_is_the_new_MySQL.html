  <p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is the new 
 <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.</p>
<p>MySQL is moving toward becoming
  a 'real' database by adding features like
  foreign key support; in doing so it is leaving 
  behind a niche of 'works for me'; a niche that will be 
  increasingly filled by SQLite.
