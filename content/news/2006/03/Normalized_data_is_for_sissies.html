  <p>My five year old son and I sat down to read a book
  a couple months back. We flopped on the couch and I 
  opened the book and began reading. He interrupted and 
  had me go back to the beginning, "Daddy, you have to read the <i>title</i> and <i>author</i>."</p>
<p>
  He had just started kindergarten and was learning the parts of 
  a book. </p>
<p>That little lesson from my five year old, and indirectly
   his kindergarten teacher, was exactly how old, powerful, 
   and deeply ingrained was the concept of a "document".
   We deal with documents every day; from weblog entries, to 
   tax forms, to books. We sort, we file, we sign, we seal, and we deliver.
</p>
<p>And the first thing we learn in computer science about storing
   data? Throw away a thousand years of ingrained lessons in 
   document management and fracture that thing called a document and store it in 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">normal form</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/10/normalized-data">
   Jason Kottke pointed to a presentation by Cal Henderson over 18 months ago</a>, 
   that takes on data normalization in a single sentence:
  "Normalized data is for sissies". And you can see from the 85 comments that
   Jason had unwittingly stepped in a sacred cow pattie.
</p>
<p>It wasn't always like that, and it's good to remember that
   <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/3106">
   relational databases themselves were a controversial idea</a>.
