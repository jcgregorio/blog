  <p>Joel has another great essay up: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html">
  The Development Abstraction Layer</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programmers need a Subversion repository. Getting a Subversion repository means you need a network, and a server, which has to be bought, installed, backed up, and provisioned with uninterruptible power, and that server generates a lot of heat, which means it need to be in a room with an extra air conditioner, and that air conditioner needs access to the outside of the building, which means installing an 80 pound fan unit on the wall outside the building, which makes the building owners nervous, so they need to bring their engineer around, to negotiate where the air conditioner unit will go (decision: on the outside wall, up here on the 18th floor, at the most inconvenient place possible), and the building gets their lawyers involved, because we're going to have to sign away our firstborn to be allowed to do this, and then the air conditioning installer guys show up with rigging gear that wouldn't be out of place in a Barbie play-set, which makes our construction foreman nervous, and he doesn't allow them to climb out of the 18th floor window in a Mattel harness made out of 1/2" pink plastic, I swear to God it could be Disco Barbie's belt, and somebody has to call the building agent again and see why the hell they suddenly realized, 12 weeks into a construction project, that another contract amendment is going to be needed for this goddamned air conditioner that they knew about <em>before Christmas </em>and they only just figured it out, and <em>if your programmers even spend one minute thinking about this</em> that's one minute too many. </p>
<p>To the software developers on your team, this all needs to be abstracted away as typing <strong>svn commit</strong> on the command line.</p>
<p>That's why you <em>have </em>management. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds of a quote I saw on an old proto-monopoly game: "Labour applied to land produces wages".
  In this case the 'land' is the code base and it's in managements best interest
  to see that labor is applied as efficiently as possible to that 'land'.
