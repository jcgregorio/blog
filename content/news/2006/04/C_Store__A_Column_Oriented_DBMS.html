  <p>From <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/index.php">CSAIL</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/projects/cstore/">C-Store</a> is a read-optimized relational DBMS that contrasts sharply with most current systems, which are write-optimized. Among the many differences in its design are: storage of data by column rather than by row, careful coding and packing of objects into storage including main memory during query processing, storing an overlapping collection of column-oriented projections, rather than the current fare of tables and indexes, a non-traditional implementation of transactions which includes high availability and snapshot isolation for read-only transactions, and the extensive use of bitmap indexes to complement B-tree structures.
