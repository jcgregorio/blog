  <p>The Web API Working Group has released the First Public Working Draft of 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060405/">The XMLHttpRequest Object</a>.
  Given the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060405/#authors">authors</a>
  the fact that it isn't much different than the 
  <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#scripted-http">
   XMLHttpRequest section in the WhatWG Web Apps specification</a> is of no surprise.
