  <p> Hey, it turns out <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/database_war_stories_2_bloglin.html">flat files and SQL have different strengths and weaknesses and  you need to consider that when choosing which one to use</a>. Oh, and you can mix and match them within the same application. Who'da thunk it? Expect that comment thread to soon be overwhelmed with the SQL-is-the-one-true-way believers.
