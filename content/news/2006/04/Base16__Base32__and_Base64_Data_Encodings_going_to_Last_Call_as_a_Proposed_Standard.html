  <p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-josefsson-rfc3548bis-02.txt">Base16, Base32, and Base64 
   Data Encodings</a> is going to <a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg02382.html">
   Last Call as a Proposed Standard</a>.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I'm not a 64 bigot, and it's not that Base16 and Base32 are bad, it's just that they're new
   and I'm afraid of the inevitable, which is, I'll predict right now, that shortly after
   this becomes a Proposed Standard someone will complain that Atom is horribly broken
   because it only accepts Base64. Mark my words.
