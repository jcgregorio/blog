<p>Far <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">various reasons</a> I am learning <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a>.
  I guess I hadn't fully internalized the "distributed" in Distributed Version Control System because
  I ran into two scenarios that were similar, but in one <code>bzr get</code> was used and 
  in the other <code>bzr branch</code> was used, so I headed for the help
  to find out the differences:
  </p>
<pre><code>$ bzr help branch
usage: bzr branch FROM_LOCATION [TO_LOCATION]
aliases: <b>get</b>, clone

Create a new copy of a branch.

...
  </code></pre>
<p>Get and branch are just aliases!</p>
<p>Then my head exploded.</p>
