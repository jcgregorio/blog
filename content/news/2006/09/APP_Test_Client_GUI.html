  Back in March I released the command line  <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Atom_Publishing_Protocol_Test_Suite">
  Atom 
  Publishing Protocol Test Suite</a>, a
  utility that, when pointed at a <del>Introspection</del> Service 
  document, would test the conformance
  of that APP implementation. That was good, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape">
  and it seems to be inspiring
  others</a>, but it's not really the best tool. There currently isn't a
  way to run just a one test, or a subset of tests,
  and it's not very interactive, just aim it at the Service document
  and fire it off. I've found that when I am developing an APP 
  server implementation what would be a lot more helpful would be
  an APP client that I could use interactively. An interactive tool
  would allow me to  incrementally implement the service and test  pieces
  as I get them working. Having an APP client that actually logged 
  the requests and responses and validated
  as it was used would be an optimal solution.
  </p>
<p>
  Introducing the APP Test Client. It does all that.
  It's a desktop application
  written in Python using <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> that works as an 
  APP client, logging and validating every transaction. Here is a screenshot 
  of it in action, working against Abdera.  Click on that image for a larger version.

</p>
<p>Currently the APP Test Client can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, update and delete entries.</li>
<li>Handle text, html, and xhtml Text Constructs.</li>
<li>Log every transaction in the bottom window.</li>
<li>Validate every Atom Entry and Feed against the FeedValidator.  </li>
</ul>
<p>What it doesn't do (Oh yeah, it's a much longer list):</p>
<ul>
<li>Export and Config buttons aren't implemented.</li>
<li>No ability to edit the author, or any other part of the Entry for that matter.</li>
<li>Currently validation is just for the entries and feeds, not on anything related to the actual protocol. </li>
<li> The Add button isn't implemented either.  </li>
<li>No support for categories.</li>
<li>Doesn't traverse 'next' links in collection documents. </li>
<li>Only tested on Ubuntu, but given that it's built
         on wxWidgets it should work on Windows and OS X.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you can pull the sources from subversion:</p>
<pre><code>$ svn co\
 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/feedvalidator/trunk/apptestsuite/ apptestsuite
</code></pre>
<p>This will pull down some of the dependencies, such
  as <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a> and 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/feedvalidator">feedvalidator</a>. 
    Others like wxWidgets and cElementTree you will need to install
  separately.
</p>
<p>To run the application:</p>
<pre><code>$ python appeditor.py
</code></pre>
<p>
  The user-interface is constructed 
  using <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/">wxGlade</a>. To modify the 
  GUI:
</p>
<pre><code>$ wxglade appeditor.wxg
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you only need to install wxGlade if you are going to
  modify the user interface, not if you are just going to run
  the APP Test Client.
</p>
<p>So it's pretty rough, feel free to pitch in with patches, tests, documentation, etc.
   Discussion will take place on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=37467">feedvalidator-users</a>
   mailing list.
