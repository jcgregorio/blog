<p>
  The idea of RESTful "Collections", i.e. doing CRUD over HTTP correctly,
  has been percolating for years now.
  A Collection is nothing more than a list, a container for resources.
  While the APP defines a Collection in terms of Atom Feed and Entry documents
  we don't have to be limited to that. 
  It's time to complete a virtuous circle;
  <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/RESTLog_Specification">RESTLog</a> 
  inspired the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> which 
  inspired <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html">David Heinemeier Hansson's</a>
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/lt-files/worldofresources.pdf">World of Resources</a> (pdf) 
  and now it's time to come full circle and get that 
  world of resources in Python.
  </p>
<p>
  In particular look at page 18 of that slide deck, where
  dispatching to a collection of people, the following URIs
  are to be handled:
  </p>
<pre><code>  GET    /people         
  POST   /people
  GET    /people/1
  PUT    /people/1
  DELETE /people/1
  GET    /people;new
  GET    /people/1;edit</code></pre>
<p>
  Now the 'new' and 'edit' URIs can be a bit ambiguous, only in the sense
  that you might not guess right away that they are nouns, and remember,
  URIs always identify nouns.
  I prefer to make the noun-ishness of them more apparent.
  </p>
<pre><code>  GET    /people;create_form
  GET    /people/1;edit_form</code></pre>
<p>
  In general, using the notation of <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a>, we are looking at URIs 
  of the form:
  </p>
<pre><code> /...people/[{id}][;{noun}] </code></pre>
<p>
  And dispatching requests to URIs of that form to functions with nice names:
  </p>
<pre><code>  GET    /people               list()
  POST   /people               create()
  GET    /people/1             retrieve()
  PUT    /people/1             update()
  DELETE /people/1             delete()
  GET    /people;create_form   get_create_form()
  GET    /people/1;edit_form   get_edit_form()
  </code></pre>
<p>
  Introducing <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/">wsgicollection</a>, a Python library that 
  does just that, simplifying 
  implementing such a Collection under WSGI.
  </p>
<p>
  Wsgicollection uses <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a> indirectly, relying on it to parse the URIs
  for {id} and {noun}. In theory it will work with any WSGI middleware that
  sets values for 'id' and 'noun' in 
  
 <del><code>environ['selector.vars']</code></del> <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/routing_args"><code>environ['wsgiorg.routing_args']</code></a>.
  Here is how you would define a WSGI application that implements a collection:
  </p>
<pre><code><span class="PreProc">from</span> wsgicollection <span class="PreProc">import</span> Collection

<span class="Statement">class</span> <span class="Identifier">RecipeCollection</span>(Collection):

    <span class="Comment"># GET /cookbook/</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">list</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># POST /cookbook/</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">create</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># GET /cookbook/1</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">retrieve</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># PUT /cookbook/1</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">update</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># DELETE /cookbook/1</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">delete</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># GET /cookbook/;create_form</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">get_create_form</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
<span class="Comment"># POST /cookbook/1;comment_form</span>
<span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">post_comment_form</span>(environ, start_response):
        <span class="Statement">pass</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this class can be easily hooked up to Selector:</p>
<pre><code><span class="PreProc">import</span> selector

urls = selector.Selector()

urls.add(<span class="Normal">'</span><span class="Constant">/cookbook/[{id}][;{noun}]</span><span class="Normal">'</span>, _ANY_=RecipeCollection())
</code></pre>
<p>
   Now that I have this Collection class it will ease implementing the APP, 
   but as I indicated earlier, the collection (CRUD) model
   goes beyond that of just Atom, and we'll dig into that next.

<b>
Update:
</b> Fixed a bug where wsgicollection directly imported selector, which it does not need to do.
  You will, however, need selector installed to run the unit tests.

Update 2:
</b> Updated to support  <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/routing_args"><code>routing_args</code></a> </p>
