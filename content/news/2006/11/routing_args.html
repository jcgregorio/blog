<p>The WSGI based URI path parsing specification that used to be referred to as <code>wsgi.url_vars</code>
   is now specified as <a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/routing_args"><code>wsgiorg.routing_args</code></a> and has now stabilized,
   with an implementation in <a href="http://lukearno.com/blog/Selector-0.8.10-Released">selector</a>. I have now updated 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/">wsgicollection</a> to be conformant, but falling back to the old
   <code>selector.vars</code> if the new style environment variable is not present.

   Yes, this stuff is moving rather fast and loose, and I 
   keep feeling the urge to yell "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com%20corner%20turn">Corner-turn!</a>", yet I 
   believe this stuff is useful, important, and will improve
   the experience of building web applications under Python,
   and at this point I'll gladly trade slow and precise 
   for fast and sloppy. The nice part of open source
   is that if we're wrong the code just doesn't get used.
