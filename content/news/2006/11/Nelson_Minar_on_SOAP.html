<p>In reaction to <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/">The S stands for Simple</a>, 
<a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/whySoapSucks.html">Nelson Minar has some very choice quotes</a>. These
are all the more pertinent since Nelson has hands-on experience with 
real world deployments of SOAP services:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As someone who bears some past responsibility for well used SOAP services (Google's APIs for search and AdWords) let me say now I'd never choose to use SOAP and WSDL again. I was wrong.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
...they boil down to massive interoperability problems. Good lord, you can't even pass a number between languages reliably, much less arrays, or dates, or structures that can be null, or... It just doesn't work.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
The deeper problem with SOAP is strong typing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This backs up my experience; if you don't have
control of both ends of the wire then loosely typed documents beat strongly typed data-structure serializations.</p>
