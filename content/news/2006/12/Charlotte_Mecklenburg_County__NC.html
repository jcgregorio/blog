<p>My planets that I constructed for the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wake/">towns in Wake County</a> have 
    been fun to read and easy to maintain.
    I know I've learned a lot about my own 
    town and, by the traffic, it appears they are
    useful to other people too, so I've decided to expand
    my coverage to <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/mecklenburg/">Mecklenburg County, which contains
    Charlotte</a>.
