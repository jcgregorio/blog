<p>
A nice set of 
 <a href="http://www.addsimplicity.com.nyud.net:8080/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf">slides</a> 
from Randy Shoup and <a href="http://www.addsimplicity.com/adding_simplicity_an_engi/">Dan Pritchett</a>
on the evolving architecture of eBay.
</p>
<p>
Lot's of interesting stuff in there, particularly on scaling their
databases:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No business logic in database</li>
<ul>
<li>No stored procedures</li>
<li>Only very simple triggers (default value population)</li>
</ul>
                                                                                  .
    <li>Move CPU-intensive work to applications</li>
<ul>
<li>Referential Integrity</li>
<li>Joins</li>
<li>Sorting</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
By the time you get to slide 28 you realize they've evolved their
very own BigTable
[<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7278544055668715642">video</a>][<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">paper</a>].

</p>
<p>
   That would be two very large successful companies 
   running their businesses on a BigTable-like backend.
   File that under: things-that-should-make-you-go-hmmm.
