<p>
This <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1597769&amp;group_id=161082&amp;atid=818434">bug</a> is now 
closed and <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a> now has support
for <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt">IRIs</a>. The code for doing such a transformation
lives in its <a href="http://httplib2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/httplib2/trunk/httplib2/iri2uri.py?view=markup">
   own file with unit tests</a> in case you
want that functionality outside of httplib2. This
is currently in trunk and will appear in the next 
release.
</p>
<p>
As an aside you will notice the first half of the file
   is a data structure, the second half is the algorithm,
   and the <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">third half</a> is the unit tests.
