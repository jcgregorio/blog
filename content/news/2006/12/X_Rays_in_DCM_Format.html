<p>
  Just a few days before leaving on our last vacation Austin 
  fell at school and severely sprained his ankle.
  In the course of the doctor visits we ended up with a 
  CD containing the X-Rays of his ankle.
  A little poking around on the CD turned up a 
  whole heap of Windows specific executables and DLLs 
  and a few likely suspects for the X-Ray images themselves.
  It turns out they are stored in <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3240.txt">DCM</a> format, which is an 
  extension that seems to have no associations under Ubuntu
  but could be opened by The Gimp nevertheless.
</p>
<p>What was even more interesting was the metadata stored
  in the image, which was extensive and included the patients name,
  the address where the X-Rays were taken, the manufacturer
  of the X-Ray machine, the name of referring doctor, and much
  much more.
</p>
<p>The DCM format is also understood by ImageMagick, which I used to 
   convert the images into PNGs, and to view
   the metadata using 'identify -verbose'.
