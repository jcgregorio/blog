Gentle reader, you have been directed to this page because you 
recently said, without sarcasm:

> "Everyone was on Twitter."

This phrase is utter nonsense, as a quick bit of math will show.
The population of the world is 8 billion people, a threshhold it just
recently crossed. The number of people on Twitter is up for debate, but we'll be generous
and presume 250 million people, or 0.25 billion people. So, in billions of people, the
ratio of people on Twitter was:

<blockquote>
  <sup>.25</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>
</blockquote>

Only one in 32 people were on Twitter, or roughly 3% of the world's population, which
is clearly not "everyone". Given the obvious incorrectness of the statement leads
to some questions:

> What exactly did you mean by "everyone"?

More importantly:

> Why is it so important to get other people to believe this prima facie falsehood?
