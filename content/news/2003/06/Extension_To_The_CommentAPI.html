   <p><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#exposingRssComments">Chris Sells</a> has a proposal for an extension to the CommentAPI. His proposal would add a new element to an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed that would point to a per-item comments <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed. That’s probably not very clear, so go read his much more lucid description. It’s very cool. Tomorrow I’ll mark up the CommentAPI specification with the proposed new verbage. Meanwhile, drop comments here or on Chris’ site, because you know the drill, “speak now or …”</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: BitWorking.org has now been updated to support the extensions to the CommentAPI, which means you will find a <code>wfw:commentRss</code> element in the <a href="http://bitworking.org/index.rss">main <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed</a>, which points to each items <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed of comments. For example, here is the feed of comments for <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Consuming_RSS_Safely?crss">Consuming <span class="caps">RSS </span>Safely</a>. Updates to the CommentAPI specification are still pending.</p>

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
     <p>Joe, could you please add dc:creator (or similar) to each item in the comments <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed? This would allow me to actually see who made each comment. Thanks.</p>
