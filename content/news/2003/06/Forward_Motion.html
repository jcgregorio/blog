  <p>There has been a great deal of <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1502.html">forward motion</a> in the Echo project today. Looks like the discussion about <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1501.html">escaping HTML</a> has come to a conclusion. Other areas that have settled seem to be <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/author">Author</a> and <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/PermaLinks">PermLinks</a>. Things are looking very good for Echo, while at the same time I'm amazed at the resiliency of the wiki for hosting this kind of discussion. Full steam ahead.</p>
