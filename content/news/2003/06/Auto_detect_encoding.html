   <p>I wonder if it would be efficient to use Bayesian methods to determine a documents encoding type? You know, for those pesky <span class="caps">XML</span> files that come in without an encoding type specified.</p>

    It's certainly possible to match, say, known words to their byte patterns, and thus encodings. The question is why?
