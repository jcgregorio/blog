   <p>The only reason users of Aggie didn’t get bit by Mark’s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/12/how_to_consume_rss_safely.html">prank</a> is that he put the rogue style attribute in the description element and not the content:encoded element. So <a href="http://aggie.sourceforge.net">Aggie</a>, while is does strip object, meta and script tags, is still vulnerable to this kind of hack. A new version of Aggie will be posted when I have this fixed.</p>

     <p>I don’t think that’s true, Joe. The Aggie parser folds content:encoded into description, if it finds any. (I already have the code that does the same for the Sam Ruby/Don Box xhtml tag, it’s just not checked in.) In any case, all such contents is checked for these tags, so I don’t see a reason to make any modifications.</p>

     <p>I didn’t think we removed style attributes. Time to do some testing.</p>
