   <p>Jon Udell has <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/03.html#a711">added an XPath search feature to the <span class="caps">OSCOM</span> slideshow.</a><br />

What makes it particularly intriguing is that both <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">XSL</span> are loaded client side and all the querying and trasformations take place there. Makes me wonder if I could do Pamphlet as a web app and still use the <span class="caps">XML</span> interface. Which reminds me that I did receive from a reader some links for <span class="caps">POST</span>‘ing <span class="caps">XML</span> from forms using JavaScript. I’ll update this post when I find that e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Updated</strong> I found it. Ben Nolan sent in pointers about Data Islands, and if you mix the Data Islands stuff with the JavaScript in Jon Udell’s <span class="caps">OSCOM</span> slideshow you should be able to “get there from here“.</p>

<li>Mozilla – <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/builder/webdesign/sitedesign/story/0,2000040415,20274592,00.htm">Make <span class="caps">XML</span> data islands work in Mozilla</a></li>

<li><span class="caps">IE </span>- <a href="http://www.topxml.com/xml/articles/datatypes/default.asp"><span class="caps">XML</span> data binding with data types</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong> Add <a href="http://mozile.mozdev.org/">Mozile</a> to the mix and it looks like a</p>
<span class="caps">WSYWIG</span> editor for Bulu can be constructed completely in the browser.

	<p><strong>Update 3</strong> Looked at the output of Mozile. Really can’t use it out of the box based on the quality of the <span class="caps">HTML</span> is generates. I’ll have to look at how customizable the output is.</p>
<p>And now for some Python stuff, first a general purpose Bayesian classifier system in Python, which if anything, it wins points for its name: <a href="http://www.divmod.org/Reverend/">Reverend</a>. And how do you import it?</p>
<p><code>from reverend.thomas import Bayes</code></p>
<p>If you have a <acronym title="Pointy Haired Boss">PHB</acronym> and are having trouble <em>selling</em> Python then you should check out <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3198">Python Success Stories</a>, a neat little <span class="caps">PDF</span> with 8 stories of successful projects that use Python, the most impressive one to me was <acronym title="Industrial Light and Magic">ILM</acronym> which uses Python across their whole production pipeline. In the further reading department, and to be filed under, “It’s the syntax, stupid“, is a research paper from Microsoft entitled, <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/Papers/oopsla.pdf">Unifying Tables, Objects and Documents</a> [via <a href="http://mattgriffith.net/permalink.aspx/99fa422c-0334-404b-b0da-444ff32419a4">Matt Griffith</a> ].</p>
<blockquote>This paper proposes a number of type-system and language extensions to natively support relational and hierarchical data within a statically typed object-oriented setting. In our approach <span class="caps">SQL</span> tables and <span class="caps">XML</span> documents become first class citizens that benefit from the full range of features avail-able in a modern programming language like C or Java. This allows objects, tables and documents to be constructed, loaded, passed, transformed, updated, and queried in a uni-fied and type-safe manner.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.makingthings.com">MakingThings</a> look like they do cool stuff. [Via <a href="http://pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/06/1285.html">Simon Fell</a>  ]</p>
<p>And one of the sanest things I’ve heard with respect to <span class="caps">RDF</span> occured today on [xml-dev] in a discussion on <span class="caps">YAML</span>. Micah Dubinko asked (I’ll update this to provide a link once the archives update.):</p>
<blockquote>So, how about a <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax for <span class="caps">RDF</span>? Might even solve the tricky problem of how to embed <span class="caps">RDF </span>(DTD-based) <span class="caps">XHTML</span>…</blockquote>

    That client side XML form idea looks really cool, you should pass on the links! Especially as I've been looking for an example somewhere while looking at tying <a href="http://mozile.mozdev.org/">mozile</a>   with a cms.
