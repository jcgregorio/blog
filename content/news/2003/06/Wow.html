<p>That moment is now, something great <em>is</em> happening, the place it's happening is <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/">Sam's Wiki</a>, and all I can is <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1488.html">Wow</a>.</p>
<p>I'm 100% behind <a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap">this kind of forward motion</a>, and will work to add support for it into Aggie, Bulu, and Pamphlet. </p>

    How do you see RESTlog fitting into the Echo framework? Alongside the SOAP and XML-RPC APIs that are bound to come out of that wiki?
