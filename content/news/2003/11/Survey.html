  <p>In working on the authentiction proposal for the Atom API, one of the underlying assumptions made was that access to the full power of .htaccess files in general and Digest authentiction in particular was rare. So do me a favor, if you are currently hosted on a system using Apache leave a comment with the name of your hosting provider and what overrides you have turned on in your account. That is, how the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#allowoverride"><code>
AllowOverride</code></a> directive is configured. For example my hosting provider is <a href="http://cornerhost.com/">Cornerhost</a> and accounts are setup with <code>AllowOverride All</code> which is very nice.
The set of options for AllowOverride is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All</li>
<li>None</li>
<li>AuthConfig</li>
<li>FileInfo</li>
<li>Indexes</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>Options</li>
</ul>

    It looks like AllowOverride None, if I read it correctly.
