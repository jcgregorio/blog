title: Atom for search results

  <p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/RDF_and_Longhorn_lessons">Yesterday</a> I talked a bit about 
  converting all my documents into HTML and then running a search engine over that. I also
  lamented that it would be easier if all the search engines were part of the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org">
  Well-Formed Web</a>. What I mean by that is using multiple search engines and combining the 
  results would be much easier if they all were able to format their results in XML. </p>

  
<p>I was still kicking that idea around today when I started thinking about what would 
  be the best format to use for search results. For example: <a href="http://swish-e.org/Discussion/search/swish.cgi?query=xml&amp;submit=Search%21&amp;metaname=swishdefault&amp;sort=swishrank">here is a search over the swish-e
  discussion list</a>, the output being in HTML of course. But look closely at that output and tell me what you see.
  I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>link</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>message date</li>
</ul>
<p>And because this is a search over a discussion archive I also see:</p>
<ul>
<li>poster's name</li>
<li>poster's e-mail</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=XML">similar search on Google</a> yields a subset of the same fields but adds in
</p>
<ul>
<li>category</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it's just a "when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail" situation, 
   but to me Atom looks like the perfect format for returning search results.</p>
<p>Note that search results are also an excellent place for some of the 
  <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/AtomAPI_Quick_Reference">features
  of the AtomAPI that have been talked about recently</a>. For example, most 
  search results don't return all the results, but only the first N. To get the 
  next N results the Atom feed format could contain a "next" link that points to the next N search results.</p>
<p class="example">&lt;link rel="next" type="application/x.atom-xml" title="Next 20 Results" href="..."/&gt;</p>
