  <p>My oldest son Christopher moved into his new bedroom 
   several months ago. It's been cramped quarters in there, so over the last 
   couple weekends we built him a new bed and desk, in the process
   creating much more space.</p>
  <p>As you can see the one piece of furniture, the top bunk of a low height bunk bed, dominates the room.

<p>The project was to build a bed into the wall, around the same height
   as the old bed, and then in the newly opened up space to add a desk.
   All through the project I had helpers.

</p>
<p>One goal of the project was to be done quickly, and to have the furniture
   be rugged, so we went with 3/4 inch plywood and a painted finish as opposed 
   to the stained finish we usually choose. The meant I could be sloppier on
   the woodworking aspect, knowing that I could fix things up with putty later.

This was a mistake since the final color we picked was a dark red, in which case we should have chosen a gray primer.

<p>The bed installed on one end of the room.

<p>Finally in the cleared space we installed the new desk and storage shelves.
