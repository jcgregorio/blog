  <p>In the long run, the waterfall model will be seen as a odd historical curiosity.</p>
<blockquote><p> Although many view iterative and incremental development as a modern
practice, its application dates as far back as the mid-1950s. Prominent
software-engineering thought leaders from each succeeding decade
supported IID practices, and many large projects used them successfully.</p></blockquote>
