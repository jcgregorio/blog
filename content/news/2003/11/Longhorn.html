  <p>Ole Eichhorn has some great observations on Longhorn and
   all the hype surrounding Microsoft's latest vaporware annoucements. 
   It is a long article covering a lot of territory and he has some choice 
   quotes on software and software development:
</p>
<blockquote><p>If you list the most "important" applications today, you'll
find that zero of them run on .NET (and zero of them run on Java),
despite the fact that .NET has been out for three years, and Java much
longer.  Why?  Because of <em>performance</em>.
