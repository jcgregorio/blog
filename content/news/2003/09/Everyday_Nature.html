  <p>I finally remembered to bring the camera to work. Now that I am 
back in the habit of getting in real early I've been wanting to 
get a shot of some of the nature around the building.</p>
   <p></p><p>I caught the local Heron basking in the morning light. He’s standing at the top of a decorative waterfall not more than 200 feet (60 meters) away from the building entrance.</p>

<p></p><p>Back at home I got this close-up of a spider that lives on the back porch. Yes, he’s really as big as the picture makes him look. Anybody know what kind of spider that is?</p>

    It's a cat spider. I doubt that's the actual name, but that's what I've always called them. I have one right now that I caught that is enormous. They are one of my favorite kinds of spider.
