  <p>Should you use Content Negotiation when building your web service?
The short answer is no. There are definite problems with <abbrev title="Content Negotiation">conneg</abbrev>
and I can give some examples of problems I have run into and also point to problems
other have run into.</p>

  
<p>First let's back up and explain Content Negotiation. Your browser is 
   a generic display program and can take in various kinds of media, such
   as HTML, JPEGs, CSS, Flash, etc. and display it for you. The first thing to
   note is that each of those kinds of media have different mime types.
   Each format has it's own registered mime type and when a client
   does a GET on a URL it gets back not only the content but the response
   also includes a <code>Content-Type:</code> header which lists
   the mime-type of what is in the body.
</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about HTTP is that it allows
   the same URI to have multiple representations. For example I 
   could have a URL that had both <code>plain/text</code> and <code>text/html</code>
   representations. Now that leads to two obvious questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>How does the server know which represenation to serve?</li>
<li>How can the browser influence the servers choice to get something it can handle?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's start by answering question two first. The browser uses the <code>Accept:</code>
   header to list out the mime-types that it is willing to accept. There is also a weighting
   scheme that allows the client to specify a preference for one media type 
   over another. For example, here is the capture of some of the headers, including the <code>Accept:</code> header,
   sent by Mozilla when it does a GET on a URI:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,\
    text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,video/x-mng,\
    image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif;q=0.2,*/*;q=0.1
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,compress;q=0.9
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Accept:</code> header list the mime-types that the browser can 
   handle along with weights of the form <code>q=</code> where the argument
   is a floating point number between 0 and 1. The weights indicate a preference
   for that media type, with a higher number inidicating a higher preference. Note that
   there are several bits of complexity I am going to ignore for now. The first is the last
   type the Mozilla browser says in can accept, */*;q=0.1. This is a wild card
   match, which will match any mime-type that the server could want to serve up. The second
   is that there are multiple Accept headers, one for language, one for encoding, another
   for charset. How these over-lap and influence the response sent won't be covered here.
</p>
<p>Now to answer the first question. The server looks at the available representations
   is has and servers up the one with the highest preference to the client.
   Based on the <code>Accept:</code>
   header it sends an appropriate representation back and indicates the type it
   chose using the <code>Content-Type:</code> header.</p>
<p>This seems like a really cool and vastly under utilized feature of HTTP. It also 
  seems particularly intriguing for web services. You could return
  JPEGs from that mapping service for the older client platforms, but also 
  serve up SVG for the newer clients so they can scale and rotate their maps. 
  What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The first thing that could go wrong is a bug or mis-configuration on the client or the server. 
   This has happened to me in the 
   past. The W3C does conneg on some of their recommendations, returning either HTML or plain 
   text based on the clients capabilities. This is fine, but one day their server was 
   either confused or mis-configured because it would only serve the recommendation in <code>plain/text</code>.
   I really needed the HTML form, but after trying multiple browsers from multipe locations I could only retrieve the text 
   format. I ended up pulling the HTML version out of the Google cache.</p>
<p>The second problem that I ran across highlights the real core problem with conneg. I was
   trying to use the W3C XSLT service to do some transformations on my web pages. Now the server side 
   software I use to run Well-Formed Web does conneg and can return either HTML or an RSS item 
   fragment for each URI. At the time I was serving up XHTML 1.0, which is valid XML and 
   thus good input into an XSLT service. So the way the XSLT service works is that you enter two URIs, one
   for the source content and the other for the XSLT sheet to apply to the source content.
   My transformation kept failing and it was because of the 
   Accept headers that the XSLT service sent when it went to retrieve the source content. 
   My server kept returning the RSS item fragment and not 
   the XHTML. Now this would have been fine if I wanted to apply an XSLT sheet to my RSS item fragment, but in this 
   case I wanted it to apply to the XHTML. Note that the problem could have been completely reversed, I could have 
   been trying to apply the XSLT to the RSS item and not to the XHTML and my server could have returned
   the XHTML all the time. The crux of the problem is that when I gave the URI to the XSLT transformation
   service I have no way of specifying what mime-type to request. I get no chance to tweak the 
   services <code>Accept:</code> header.
</p>
<p>Let's cover that again to clarify. If I hand you a URI only, and that URI supports conneg,
   then I get no control over which representation you retrieve. In the cases where you are
   passing a URI into a service that is later going to retrieve a represenation from that URI, you 
   really have no idea which representation it's going to get. That could mean that you end up 
   passing your RSS feed to the W3C HTML validator, or you end up passing XHTML instead of RSS into
   an XSLT translator service, or you end up passing a 12MB PNG to a handheld instead of 
   that 20KB SVG file. You end up with a problem that is hard to debug and 
   one that wouldn't exist if each URI had only one mime-type.</p>
