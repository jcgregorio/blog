    Hi Joe, My name is Zhang Yining (Zhang being the surname). Having been participated in Pie/Echo/Atom since begining, I would definitely like to meet you up and talk over about Atom. <br />
I am a China citizen currently working in Singapore, and very likely to take a holiday off during new year (both global new year and Chinese new year) and go back to China, maybe we could meet up then in Beijing. Do drop me a mail once your schedule is set and I will then see how to plan mine.
