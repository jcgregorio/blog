title: Please do not use D as an ACCESSKEY in your HTML

  <p>Congrats, your new site is redesigned, all shiny and new, and in the 
   redesign you decided to cover <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">accessibility</a> and 
   in the process start using 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey">accesskey</a>. 
   Now <code>accesskey</code> is neat, in that it
   which gives you the power to re-map keys to move the keyboard
   focus to a control or to follow a link, but with that power comes responsibility. 
   You can add an <code>accesskey</code> attribute 
   to <code>a</code>, <code>area</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>input</code>, 
   <code>label</code>, <code>legend</code>, and <code>textarea</code>. </p>
<p>I use the keyboard shortcuts for
   all my applications as much as possible. One of those keyboard shortcuts I use all day is
   Alt-D, which from within Mozilla or IE will jump the keyboard focus to the address bar of
   the browser. Unless of course, I'm reading your webpage where you have defined the ACCESSKEY D 
   to jump to some particular link or web form element. 
   <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168905">Bugzilla</a> is one such example. 
   That is annoying. Don't do that. You are actually <strong>reducing</strong> your sites accessibility. While were at 
   it, never define ACCESSKEY bindings for:</p><p>
<ul>
<li>F - <u>F</u>ile</li>
<li>B - <u>B</u>ookmarks</li>
<li>E - <u>E</u>dit</li>
<li>V - <u>V</u>iew</li>
<li>G - <u>G</u>o</li>
<li>T - <u>T</u>ools</li>
<li>H - <u>H</u>elp</li>
<li>A - F<u>a</u>vorites</li>
</ul>
</p><p>Your safest bet, if you want access keys, is to bind them to numeric keys only, which has the smallest 
   chance of conflicting with browser based keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> <a href="http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/">Damian Cugley</a> points out that the exact keys listed above can't be counted in because the shortcut keys for the browser depend on the I18N of the browser. All the more reason to stick to numeric access keys.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Just stumbled across another site: <a href="http://www.nfb.ca/e/index.html">National Film Board of Canada</a>. Do I need to start a running list?

    <p>The other trick is that the access-keys that cannot be used will vary according to the locale of your reader, because the words they are mnemonic for will of course be spelled differently...</p>
<p>The best approach I can think of to that little problem is to make sure that when I internationalize a web page, the access keys are included in the i18n effort. That will not save someone who is reading your page in English in a non-English browser, but that can't be helped.</p>

    FYI, Ctrl-L puts focus on the address bar in Mozilla, and mozilla derivatives (Firebird, etc).

    <p>Actually thie problem in my mind isn't the websites that do this it is the user agent.  </p>
<p>A system key binding should not be able to be overridden by HTML.  </p>
<p>One could go so far to assert that it is a security issue (I wouldn't) in that the standard behavior the user expects is now provided with a different mechanism.  For example if you caught Alt-D event and then called a trigger to redirect you to another site...</p>
<p>Ideally the user agent would allow you to prevent this and even give the user a warning that a site is attempting to provide a new implementation of a standard key binding.</p>

  I agree, that fact that the access keys and user agents use the same meta key seems like a bug and not a feature.

    If the user agent we talk about is Mozilla, then we talk about bug 128452:<br />

    Better tell that to the people on the site I link! Although they recommend the government numerical standard (which has been widely adopted internationally), they do suggest alt+D...

    we're forgetting that Ctrl-Tab focuses the Address bar in IE<br />
[not that I use IE under Linux : )]
