  <p><a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2003/US/index.html">ApacheCon</a>, the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation, will be held in Las Vegas this November 16-19, and you should seriously consider attending. There's an impressive list of
<a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2003/US/html/speakers.html">speakers</a> for this show and lot's of cool <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2003/US/html/sessions.html">sessions</a>.
</p>
<p>And, as <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/09/16#585">Ted Leung</a> kindly put it, there will be a "bonus" this year, as I will be presenting on Extending HTTP Authentication and <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> will be presenting on the AtomAPI. I'm  looking forward to meeting many of you in person, so go <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2003/US/html/registry.html">register</a> today, because it gets more expensive the later you wait.</p>
