  <p>"Teach me. Teach me. Teach me.", my nine year old said as he bounced in front of me.</p>
<p>"No", I said, "I can teach you woodworking if you want, or maybe some skateboarding tricks?"</p>
  <p>"No. Teach me that."</p>
<p>"How about cooking, or computer programming?"</p>
<p>"No", he said resolutely, "I want you teach me how to do that."</p>
<p>"No, you are not to learn that from your father", Lynne yelled from the next room.</p>
<p>"See, your mother agrees with me, now what I else can I teach you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing", he said and sulked off into the living room.</p>
<p>"So that's it? It's 'teach me how to belch on demand' or nothing, eh?"</p>

    I am proud to say I taught my young cousins this lost art.

    <p>I taught my own nine year old the basics of belching, but not the advanced techniques such as long-belching nor machine-gun-belching.</p>
<p>No, grasshopper.Â  Some things are better discovered.</p>

    There are a lot of things that my wife won't let me teach our kids. But she's resigned to the fact that they will one day learn how to belch at will. And if I'm not the one to teach them, it will be her brother. :)
