  <p>Just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399149864/bitworking-20">
Pattern Recognition</a>
by <a href="http://williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/archive.asp">William Gibson</a>. I really enjoyed
the book, the prose and pacing were great. Now I'm sitting here in a post-gibson-book-buzz,
that infinite possibilities feeling riding on smooth rails of language. Just like when I finished
all his other books, I try hard not to read anything else, lest it break the spell.
