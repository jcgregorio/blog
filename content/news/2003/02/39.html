<li>Maybe I should spend a litte more time paying attention to local politics. I had no idea
      there was work afoot to get Raleigh a <a href="http://www.raleighconvention.com/ccsc/">new convention center</a>. 
      After seeing convention centers in other cities including Atlanta and <a href="http://www.mccormickplace.com/">Chicago</a>
      I can only describe the current Raleigh convention center as pathetic.</li>
<li>Wow, and I felt privileged when the print media showed up to the RTP Bloggers lunch. When <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/2003/02/23.html#a3712">Jim Lehrer shows up...</a></li>
<li>Fixed my CSS so that my font sizes are specified in percent and not pixels. Now I can't be accused of being a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103807/2002/08/31.html">fb</a>. Wouldn't you love be authoritative in Google's eyes for that?</li>
<li>Speaking of Google, I found out this weekend that I own the works <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=stigmergy">Stigmergy</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Well-Formed">Well-Formed</a> on Google. The real interesting 
       part is that when searching for stigmery just a couple months ago all the hits I got were biology related papers. Ouch.</li>
<li>Looks like <a href="http://Fristrom.editthispage.com/2003/02/11#a110">Westwood</a> has closed. You have no idea how much of my life was wasted on the Command &amp; Conquer series. At my last job, every day at lunch, for two years, we played one of their games. I have flashbacks to key battles. Flashbacks...</li>
<li>Got the comment system working on RESTLog this weekend. One last feature and a little more testing before before a release. The last feature
       to add is the ability to turn comments on and off for individual posts.</li>
</ul>
