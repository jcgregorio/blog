  <p>Now back from my trip to Chicago. Had some spare time
this trip to take in some sights. Visited the <a href="http://www.navypier.com/">Navy Pier</a>
for a while and enjoyed the <a href="http://www.navypier.com/SubLink.cfm?Main_ID=15&amp;Sub_ID=7">Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows</a>.
Wandering around looking at all the stained glass reminded me of much
of the flash animation you see today. Bold black outlines of solid color. 
So who's going to be the Tiffany of Flash?
</p>
<p>Anyway I really enjoyed being in Chicago.
The convenience of a large city just can't be beat, a grocery store
across the street, and a mall occupying four stories of the builing 
across the adjoining street. The hotel was located perfectly
with the stairs leading down to the red-line right by the 
front door. That came in very convenient when we needed
to take a late Sunday night trip to Kinkos for some final
preparation for the show. Just two stops on the red-line and we
were within a block walk of the Kinkos, and the total trip including
the work at Kinkos was less than an hour. Back here in the suburbs of 
North Carolina the driving to and fro would have taken up more 
than an hour.</p>
