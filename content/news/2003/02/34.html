<h3>Improvements in Feed Retrieval</h3>
<dl>
<dt>HTTP Compression</dt>
<dd>
                    Added support for HTTP compression. [Simon Fell]</dd>
<dt>RssHarvest</dt>
<dd>
                    Aggie can now be taught how to 
                    transform any structured web page into an RSS feed. This is useful for sites 
                    that produce content in an orderly fashion, but publish no RSS feeds of their 
                        own (such as MSDN). See <a href="RssHarvest.html">here</a> for details [Ziv Caspi]</dd>
<dt>XSLT transformation of XML documents into RSS feeds</dt>
<dd>
                    Aggie can also directly transform XML content into RSS feeds if you provide it 
                    with a proper XSLT transform. To subscribe to a feed whose URL is
                    <i>xmlurl</i> and whose transform into RSS is <i>xslurl</i>, use the following
                    URL: <b>xslt:?xmlfile=<i>xmlurl</i>&amp;xslfile=<i>xslurl</i>&amp;title=<i>feedTitle</i></b>.

<h3>Improved Output</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Output Items as SMTP Messages</dt>
<dd>
                    Optionally, Aggie can send SMTP mail messages to your Email account. You can 
                    have each new item in its own message, all new items in a given feed in a 
                    single message, or all new items in a given feed with the same title in a 
                    single message. See <a href="Emailer.html">here</a> for details. [Tim Danner, Ziv Caspi]</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Improved RSS Parsing and Vocabulary</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Robust and extensible RSS parser</dt>
<dd>
                    The RSS parser has been completely rewritten. It is now very robust, will let 
                    you know if the feed is not stricly XML but will still parse non-well-formed 
                    feeds (within reason). Additionally, it is extensible, so you can ask it to 
                    parse elements that it does not know about. [Ziv Caspi]</dd>
<dt>"Shame into submission"</dt>
<dd>
                    If the RSS parser finds a feed which is not strictly well-formed, but it still 
                    readable, it generates a detailed description of what is wrong with the feed, 
                    to help authors locate problems. [Ziv Caspi]
                </dd>
<dt>New RSS elements supported</dt>
<dd>
                    In addition to title, link, and description elements, Aggie now supports Dublin 
                    Core date, encoded content, CDATA descriptions, RDF encoded content, and 
                    Trackback pings. [Ziv Caspi]</dd>
<dt>Support for base element</dt>
<dd>
                    Aggie can now identify feeds that publish their "base", and automatically 
                    provide the proper HTML base element. This feature works only for mail output, 
                    and is most useful with RSSHarvest-ed feeds. [Ziv Caspi]</dd>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Installer</dt>
<dd>
                    Now has an installation program.
                </dd>
<dt>Bug fixes</dt>
<dd>
                    Multiple bug fixes have been applies, which are too numerous to include here. 
                    [All]</dd>
