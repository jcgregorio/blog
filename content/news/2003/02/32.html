  <p>I grew up in the sticks of Connecticut. No public transportation
in a town of 2,000 people. We would occasionallly take
trips into Boston and I always loved it. There is something 
I find comforting in a crowd, 
in the hustle and bustle. It doesn't hurt that everyone in Chicago
is so damn nice. People meet your gaze, return a smile, say hello.
In that way it even beats out Boston. </p>
<p>The one thing I haven't mentioned yet is the money. In Chicago, probably
like in any major city, there is a whole other realm of money
above and beyond anything seen in Raleigh.
A surreal moment is driving down Michigan Avenue, and there, written in the same kind of marker
you see on the windshields of used cars for sale, is a sign scrawled
across a store front window:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Condos $1.5M and up."</p></blockquote>
