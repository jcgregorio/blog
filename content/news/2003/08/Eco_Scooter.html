  <p>Christopher worked hard all summer baby sitting his youngest brother, mowing the lawn and 
  doing chores around the house, all with the aim of collecting enough money to 
  buy an electric scooter. Well he finally saved enough and it arrived this week. 
  The <a href="http://www.ecoscooters.com/nomal/index.htm">EcoScooter</a> he 
  bought is a neat little electric scooter that runs on 24 volt batteries, 
  runs for about a half an hour on a full charge, goes about 15-18 miles an hour
  depending on rider weight, and is really fun to ride. </p>

  <p>Here is Christopher in action:</p>

    <p>I am pretty sure you can call them at the number listed on this page: <a href="http://www.ecoscooters.com/nomal/warranty.htm">http://www.ecoscooters.com/nomal/warranty.htm</a></p>
<p>As for the steering wheel, at the base is a black handle on a bolt that is used to tighten a collar around the base of the handle bar. This is the same type of collar that is used on the top and bottom of the seat post to attach it to the seat and the base.</p>
