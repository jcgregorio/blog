  <p>Previously I talked about the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Six_Places">six different places</a> there are to
   store information in an HTTP transaction. This is slightly misleading.
</p>

  <p> To review, the six places are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Request URI</li>
<li>Request Headers</li>
<li>Request Content</li>
<li>Response Status Code</li>
<li>Response Headers</li>
<li>Response Content</li>
</ol>
<p>This is slightly misleading because the URI is listed as a single
   storage location. This isn't the best characterization, as it really
   contains two different sets of information: the path, and the query parameters.</p>
<p>Now the path part of a URI usually corresponds to the directory structure on the server.
   But remember that the path structure of a server is completely controlled
   by that server and it need not corresponse to any file or directory strucure.
   While it is at times convenient to map it to a directory structure, this isn't required, 
   and it is possible to pass path information to a 
   CGI program. For example, if you do a GET on the following URL:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>http://example.org/cgi-bin/test.py/fred/12
</code></pre>
<p>and there exists a program named <code>test.py</code> in the <code>cgi-bin</code> directory
   then that program will be executed. The remaining path after the program is passed
   to the CGI program in the PATH_INFO environment variable. In contrast, if query
   parameters are passed in, they are passed to the CGI program
   via the QUERY_STRING environment variable.</p>
<p>For example, if this is the script <code>test.py</code>:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>import os
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n"
print "PATH_INFO = %s" % os.environ['PATH_INFO']
print "QUERY_STRING = %s" % os.environ['QUERY_STRING']</code></pre>
<p>And it handles the GET for this URI:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.py/reilly/12?id=234454</code></pre>
<p>It will display:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>PATH_INFO = /reilly/12
QUERY_STRING = id=234454
</code></pre>
<p>Note how the piece of the path below test.py has been stripped off and made
   available via <code>PATH_INFO</code>, while the query parameters are
   stored in the QUERY_STRING environment variable.
</p>
<p>So HTTP, via the structure of a URI, gives you two distinct places
   to store information, one in the path and the second in the query parameters.
   This isn't even the full story, because if you are running Apache and have
   the ability to use .htaccess files you can use 
   <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> and map URIs so that they appear
   as paths but show up in the CGI as query parameters, but we won't cover that
   now.
