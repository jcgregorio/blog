title: The HTTP verb PUT under Apache Safe or Dangerous?

  <p>"Is the HTTP verb PUT under Apache safe or dangerous?" This is a question I come across often, and have now 
  run into it twice in the work on Atom. So is it safe? The answer is maybe.</p>
  <p>Here are two such examples:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Using DELETE and PUT may be the "right thing to do" 
  in an ideal world, but the fact of the matter is that a 
  lot -- if not the vast majority -- of webservers do not allow these 
  operations. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If anyone knows of a newer article describing 
  HTTP PUT with apache, I would be very interested in seeing it. Because, 
  due to my experience with PUT, you have to define a single PUTScript in 
  httpd.conf, and if you PUT something to an apache server at the URI 
  www.example.com/blog/entries/1 or something similar, apache passes all 
  of the information to the PUTScript, not to anything else.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both of the above quotes are from the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RestEchoApiPutAndDelete">Atom Wiki discussion 
  of the use of PUT</a>. A little digging reveals that the ApacheWeek article 
  <a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put">Publishing Pages with PUT</a> 
  is referenced most often when the danger of PUT is raised. </p><p>
</p><p>That ApacheWeek article does talk about the dangers of PUT and
  the cautions you need to follow when writing a script that
  does content publishing via PUT. That key part of that phrase
  is <strong>content publishing</strong>. That means that PUT is being 
  used to upload arbitrary content to the server and the client
  is determining via the URI where the content should be stored.
  Now you can imagine how this might be dangerous, for example
  not correctly checking URI paths that include <code>../..</code> could
  let a malicious agent re-write your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>Implementing a PUT script can be difficult and a security hazard
   in the context of content publishing, but that's the case because
   the client is choosing the target URI and the client could upload
   any content type. In the case of Web Services in general, and
   the AtomAPI in particular, PUT is used in a much narrower manner
   and avoids those potential security problems.</p>
<p>In the case of the AtomAPI PUT is only allowed on URIs that point 
   to a pre-existing resource. The
   AtomAPI follows a general idiom for editing resources of doing 
   a GET to retrieve the original XML, then a PUT on the same URI
   to upate that resource with the edited XML. No URIs are created 
   by doing a PUT. PUT is not accepted on arbitrary URIs. This makes
   the use of PUT in the context of the AtomAPI just as safe as POST.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways to configure Apache to process
   incoming requests. In particular it is possible to have a single
   script that handles all PUT requests below a chosen directory. This 
   strategy, and all of the associated security concerns associated with
   it, are covered fully in the <a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put">Publishing Pages with PUT</a>.</p>
<p>When processing request with a CGI script all the PUT requests
   will come through. The verb is passed to the CGI program via the REQUEST_METHOD environment 
   variable, and the program decides what to do with the content.</p>
<p>Using PUT propoerly has advantages in Web Service development. First,
   Apache lets you control security based on the verb using the 
   <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#limit">Limit</a> 
   and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#limitexcept">LimitExcept</a>
   directives, which
   let you restrict access controls based on the verb. Here is a sample 
   of one of my <code>.htaccess</code> files that restricts the use of 
   all verbs except GET to the CGI program <code>Bulu.cgi.</code></p>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;Files Bulu.cgi&gt;
AuthType Basic
AuthName myrealm
AuthUserFile /path/to/my/password/file
  &lt;LimitExcept GET&gt;
  Require valid-user
  &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;
&lt;/Files&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_actions.html#script">Script</a>
   directive can be used to dispatch to a CGI program based on the verb used:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>Script PUT /cgi-bin/put.cgi</code></pre>
<p>The second advantage using PUT brings is clarity. Given the idiom
   of using GET/PUT in tandem on a URI to edit resources PUT
   clearly signals what the interface is doing.</p>
