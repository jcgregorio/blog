  <p>I have tried this <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink.html">link checking service from the W3C</a>, just drop in a URL and will check all the URLs on the page, looking for dead links or malformed ones. Cool, but just one problem, it fails with a 404 on every single link on my site. I think it's a content negotiation thing but haven't had the time to download the source to try to fix it. Found via my referrer logs.</p>
