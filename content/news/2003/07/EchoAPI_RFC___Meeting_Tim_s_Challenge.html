  <p>Tim Bray, in <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/03/HTTP-RSS">A Web Interface for Web Publishing</a>, outlined a quick version of a REST based Web Publishing interface using the not-Echo format. As Tim points out this is similar in spirit to what <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/5">RESTLog</a> does.</p>
<p>To keep Forward Motion on this topic, I have posted a rough draft, in RFC format, of a similar <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/echoapi.html">publishing API using not-Echo</a>. I have also created a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RestEchoApi">discussion area
on the wiki</a> for this proposal.</p>

    I tried posting via the CommentAPI, but it didn't seem to work.Â  At any rate, I'd like to suggest an alternative... Take a look at <a href="http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49">http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49</a>.
