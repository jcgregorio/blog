  <p><a href="http://www.gluelogix.com">GlueLogix</a> is the creation of Larry Martin, one of my co-workers. From the home page:</p>
<blockquote><p> In most shops, the regular staff has its hands full building up the big pieces.  That's the way it should be - your core people should be concentrating on your core technology.  But when marketing pops up and says, "That's nice, but it's not a product without a USB jack," what do you do?</p>
<p> I think you should call me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone else starting a new company is <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/">John Robb</a> who is back with his venture <a href="http://www.mindplex.org">Mindplex</a>.</p>
<p>This is real cool and I want to wish both John and Larry the best of luck.</p>
