  <p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/07/10.html#a740">This entry by Jon Udell</a> is rather 
disappointing, mostly because it sits on the false presumption that choosing and using an API
to update a blog with is a binary decision. Far from it, the Blogger, LiveJournal and metaWeblogAPI
have co-existed for quite some time, with clients supporting all of them. If the Pie project 
succeeds in producing a new API, that will not mean the immediate removal of those APIs, nor will
all the current software magically break the instant the RFC is approved. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I was gratified to read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Were there no legacy to consider, I'd much prefer the new approach. [<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/07/10.html#a740">Jon Udell</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I would like to inject that RESTLog <strong>isn't</strong> the EchoAPI, but 
  I am glad to have RESTLog be one of the EchoAPIs inspirations.</p>
