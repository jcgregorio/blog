  <p><blockquote>I don't buy the argument that programmers benefit from a Web Services toolkit. Such things do not build applications -- at most they automate the production of security holes. Getting two components to communicate is a trivial process that can be accomplished using any number of toolkits (including the libwww ones). The difficult part is deciding what to communicate, when to communicate it, in what granularity, and how to deal with partial failure conditions when they occur. These are fundamental problems of data transfer and application state. [<a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000016.html">Roy Fielding</a>]</blockquote></p>
