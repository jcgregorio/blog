  <p>This is how the year begins.</p>
<p>At 4 am.</p>
<p>On the first day of the year.</p>
<p>Lynne and I kiss our three boys good-bye.</p>
<p>The first day starts at 4 am and is twenty-five hours long. 
   Twenty-five hours of waiting for planes,
   riding on planes, and waiting for the next plane.
</p>
<p>Waiting to get to China.</p>
<p>This is not just Lynne and I.</p>
<p>This is a team.</p>
<p>This is a team effort.</p>
<p>Family.</p>
<p>Friends.</p>
<p>Neighbors.</p>
<p>The staff at our adoption agency.</p>
<p>The staff at the orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the red thread works</strong>.</p>
<p>It weaves it's way around the planet.
   Through a hundred people. It ties them together
   in a story. A story that begins and ends with
   me holding my daughter.</p>

    I hope your New Year is truly a joyous one. I can't tell you how wonderful it has been to have a daughter. You will find out.
