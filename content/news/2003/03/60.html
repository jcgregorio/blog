  <p>Adoption of the CommentAPI is taking off. 
  <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1272.html">Sam Ruby</a>
  is talking about adding it to mombo, while
  Dare Obasanjo will add it to his <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml02172003.asp">RSS Bandit</a> if Sam follows through.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ted Leung has added support in his
   <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/03/14#91">pyblosxom comments</a> and 
   <a href="http://www.xasperate.com/200303archive001.asp#1047841215001">Adrian Frost</a> is 
   working on support for it in BlogWorks.</p>
<p>Drop me a note if you know of other blogging software or aggregators
   that are supporting the CommentAPI that I haven't mentioned here. Thanks.</p>

    Not any time soon given the current architecture of Aggie. With all the display handled by an external browser it is impossible to do without embedding a web server inside Aggie, something I am not keep to do. I have considered embedding either IE or Moz into Aggie. Don't know which one would make it easier to hook into.

    Well, figuring that Jot wouldn't last very long unless it started supporting some of the XML stuff out there, I have added support for Joe Gregorio's "CommentAPI":http://wellformedweb.org/story/9 in two ways:

    Umm... was <title></title> supposed to contain the authors name or the "title" of the comment (if there is one)?  I was expecting the contents of <author></author> to show up.

btw, that last comment was mine.  And it was generated via the CommentAPI from Jot (sorta like a TrackBack).

    Joe, I don't know about Moz, but embedding IE in a WinForms window is very easy if all you want to do is viewing. Adding events between IE and its container shouldn't be too hard, although I admin I never tried that one myself.

    Ziv,
   I did try it once with IE and couldn't get it to embed. If you want to try it please do.
