  <p>FYI, if you are concerned about <a href="http://www.fibiger.org/archives/2003_02.html#000509">RSS security</a>, 
you will be happy to know that Aggie RC5 strips
all script, object and meta tags from text before displaying it. 
I have constructed an <a href="http://bitworking.org/rsstest/rsstest.opml">opml file</a> I use for testing. The opml file contains links to five RSS feeds
that test security, and other RSS parsing problems. The individual RSS feeds can also
be loaded directly from this <a href="http://bitworking.org/rsstest/">directory</a>, where the
feeds that test security are named <code>security<b>N</b>.xml</code>. Feel free to use these resources to test 
your aggregator of choice.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://almostperfect.editthispage.com">Ingve Vormestrand</a> for originally
pointing out these flaws with Aggie and working up the 
test feeds.</p>
