  <p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/19/dive-into-xml.html">Mark Pilgrims latest article</a> in <a href="http://xml.com">XML.com</a>,
   is not only a really good read on XHTML, XML, HTML and mime-type but also  
   has a really good example of what I am complaining about with the verbosity and akwardness of DOM.
   Take a look at #6 in his list of caveats for transitioning to <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.
   What used to take one line of code expands to six. Six lines of code just to do what used to
   take one line just because when working with XHTML server up with a mime-type
   of <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> JavaScript is restricted to using just
   the DOM to manipulate the content.
