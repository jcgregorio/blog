  <p>Andrew Watt has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2003Mar/0036.html">raised</a> some questions on the security in XForms:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two potential sources of security concern:<br />
1. That a malicious XForms-containing document can upload files from a user's <br />
computer without their knowledge<br />
2. A malicious XForms-containing document could download a virus or other <br />
nasty to the user's computer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>However, 
the current CR seems to rely largely on implementers' common sense ... a 
dangerous commodity where security is concerned ... rather than provide a 
detailed consideration of the risks (perhaps only simply to dismiss them?) 
and solution for these potential security concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember that XForms is supposed to be a <em>general</em> forms solution and as such
is not tied to a browser, so the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice11.html#submit-options">XForms Specification</a> covers submission via
http, https, smtp and native file system. That excess generality, or at least the lack of any
security guidelines in the specification regarding submissions, seems to be the source of the security concerns.

<p>Andrew also posted the same message to <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200303/msg00391.html">[xml-dev]</a>,
in case you care to follow the action in both arenas.</p>
