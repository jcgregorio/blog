title: Tim Bray XML Is Too Hard For Programmers

  <p>Ok, when I ask for <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/40">Regex-able XML</a>, and complain that the pathologies
  of XML are the root cause of the problem, I might sound like
  a simpering newbie who just doesn't know how to use the available
  tools. So how about listening to a guy who's been doing XML
  longer than almost anybody: <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/16/XML-Prog">Tim Bray</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This ends up being a closed loop. Tim Bray emailed me and it turns out that the
   "lengthy and compelling rant on the same subject from another programmer out there somewhere" 
   was in fact my rant on <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/40">Regex-able XML</a>.

    Heh. That was my first thought when I read his post, that if he hadn't read your rant he should have.
