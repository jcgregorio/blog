  <p>Is it me or does OpenOffice 1.1 load <strong>a lot</strong> faster when you 
   install it without Java?</p>
<p><a href="http://xmlsoft.org/index.html">Libxml2</a> is a great XML library written in C that includes support for XPath, XPointer and XInclude implementations, DOM and SAX like interfaces. Version 2.6.1 is out, just 9 days after 2.6.0 was released. [via <a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2092">xmlhack</a>]</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've posted anything on CSS. Right now for me it's at
  the point of just being a tool. Cool stuff is still being explored in
  this area such as these CSS menus on 
  <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/10/27/mose_menus/index.php">
  mezzoblue</a>. As a side-note I also like
  the subtle permalinks for the comments.</p>

  is now using <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2003/04/0020.html">
  Simon Fell's RESTLog implementation</a> on his server.

<p>Does Microsoft's  XAML sound eerily familiar? Check out this 
  <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2003_10.html#a000239">comprehensive 
  article on the WaSP BUZZ</a> about all the prior art and similar systems
  already being used today. I think this is a first for MS as they  normally borrow
  their ideas from competing commerical outfits. I think this is the first time
  MS has borrowed so heavily from what is ostensibly an open source original.</p>

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    I would have expected the little speech bubble icons to be the permalink, instead of a post-fixed arbitrary glyph :-(
