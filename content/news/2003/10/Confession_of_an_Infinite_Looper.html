title: Confession of an Infinite Looper

  <p>I admit it. I'm a looper. I will load up a single track on CD or mp3 and put it on infinite loop. The same song. Over and over. For possibly days at a time. I know I'm not the only one, so fess up if you're a looper too.</p><p>
</p><p>Some of my favorites for looping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ozzy Osbourne - Crazy Train</li>
<li>The President of the United States of America - Feather Pluckin</li>
<li>Iron Maiden - Childhood's End</li>
<li>Talking Heads - Once In A Lifetime</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Today's post is brought to you by Warrant's "Down Boys", which I've been looping since Monday...</em></p>

    I saw "Lost in Translation" last Friday and have been playing Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's "Just Like Honey" ever since.

    <p>I am a looper too although I usually loop for only a few hours playing songs like:</p>
<p>Alphaville - Forever Young<br />
Vivaldi - Spring<br />
Eagles - Hotel California<br />
Emotions - Best of My Love<br />
Isley Brothers - Shout<br />
James Brown - Play that funky music<br />
Lee Soo Young - Final Fantasy X Theme<br />
Madonna - Ray of Light<br />
Norah Jones - Don't Know Why<br />
Savage Garden - I Knew I Love You<br />
Vanessa William - Colors of the Wind</p>
<p>I think the wide variety is due to my being moody. :-)</p>

    <p>Songs I've looped for several days:<br />
Red House Painters - Revelation Big Sur<br />
Alanis Morissette - No Pressure Over Cappucino<br />
Everything But The Girl - Driving (cover)<br />
Jeff Buckley - Last Goodbye<br />
Massive Attack - Protection<br />
They Might Be Giants - Where Do They Make Balloons<br />
(etc)</p>
<p>As for whole CDs I have looped for days or even weeks, the list goes on. I "learn" entire CDs at a time. For the most part, I wake up with a song in my head and have to scramble to put it on so that it doesn't eat up my brain for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>In the past few months I consistently loop through all my Pizzicato Five tracks on iTunes (8 hours' worth) to stay awake. It's pretty hard to feel down when you're listening to J-pop. :)</p>

    <p>My wife happen to look over my shoulder when I was reading this.  "Hah! See?!? I'm not the only one."  She's more of a James Tailor and Van Morrison looper (as classics go).  Otherwise, its every new album.  Right now, it's Dido and Ben Harper, with REM likely on the horizon.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of a guy I knew in college who was really into the various RPGs.  In one (Rifts maybe), he had created a character who was some sort of techno-enhanced soldier.  The background story was that in the heat of a battle, a direct hit caused his music device to get fused to the jack in his head, also breaking the device so it could not be turned off.  One song played over and over and over: "rooster" by Alice in Chains.</p>
<p>There was no point to the story.  The post just reminded me of it.</p>

    I tend to play Meat Beat Manifesto's "It's the music" over and over again when driving my car. Other favs are "Circle Jack (Chase the magic word lego-lego" by Melt Banana; "The Empty Page" by Sonic Youth; come to think of it, I'm a pretty damn looper myself...
