  <p>Today I had an enlightening conversation with <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> 
   about the strengths and weaknesses of various authentication schemes. The
   end conclusion seems to be that either you sign/digest the body 
   of all your requests and responses, or you are open to man-in-the-middle
   attacks. Which does raise the question, what level
   of security are you comfortable with?</p>

  <span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yeah, unless I am seriously mis-reading WSSE, it offers little to no protection at least compared to Digest<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   I disagree<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  let me list some things<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  we can hit each one point by point<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  1. does not prevent a man in the middle attack<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  2. does not prevent a malicious proxy to redirect or change the request or the response<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  3. does not do a 'challenge' this forcing the client to send auth info with *every* request<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   tell me when you hit the end of the list<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  4. does not prevent against replay attacks<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  (end)<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   ok. Now, let me present a few points, and then I will address each of yours. Fair enough?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yes<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   With server issued nonces, unauthorized clients can provoke the server to issue new nonces at will.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   The server needs to keep track of these nonces and compare them against every inbound request.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   It is very easy to mount a denial of service attack in this manner.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  (tell me when you're at the end of your list)<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   With client nonces, the server only needs to keep track of nonces from authenticated clients. This means that only authorized users can mount a denial of service attack.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   2. with server challenges, a client can upload a 4 megapixel picture across a 56k line, just to be told "sorry, try again".<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   just a sec... now I have mark's article up. Looking for a key phrase...<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   damn, I can't find it.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   anyway. before I address your points, care to comment on mine?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ok<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  1. the server can generate nonces that are encoded time stamps, that way they have explicit expiration in them, but yes, if you don't do that then you are vulnerable to this<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   time stamps still need to be valid for a range of time. This is true also for WSSE.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   In fact, it is the basis for WSSE in preventing replay attacks (your point 4)<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   if the server keeps track of client nonces that it has accepted (until they expire), then it can stop all replay attacks.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  that range of time could be under a minute<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   this is common to both approaches.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  2. your use of WSSE has the same problem<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   ?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  because the auth goes with the payload<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   A request with valid authentication will succeed. It won't be challenged.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  you could send a large file and have it fail auth<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  oh, ok<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   so far, all I have pointed out are annoyances, not fatal problems<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   but will you conceed these two?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  but then they're the same here, once you are past the first auth, you should be fine<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   "first auth" depends on how the client is structured. Maintaining a next nonce in a multithreaded environment is difficult, but lets not digress.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   In any case, it seems to me that you are arguing against your third point.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   But that isn't really your strongest point, lets focus on the others.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   having the server keep track of nonces until they expire stops simple replay attacks. No matter who issues the nonce.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   Agreed?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  and nextnonce isn't necessarily the right way to go, turns out using a nonce count 'nc' is used more often because you can do Digest in a pipelined scenario<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yes, either track the nonces or use a nonce count, that helps prevent replay attacks, agreed<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   so that's point 4.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   point 2 applies to both approaches. By not signing the data, the data can be modified in transit.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  not quite<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  let's back up a bit<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   what this means is that both of these approaches merely stop passive sniffing.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   I'm getting to your first point. That's where the real flaw is.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  Digest always encodes the verb and the target URI into the digest<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   but I can still change the payload<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  which causes 1 and 2 for problems<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  if the server hasn't demanded 'auth-int' then yes, otherwise the request and response are immune also<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  from tampering that is<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   searching for auth-int, I came across a real gem:<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   http://www.xiven.com/blog-data/auth_source.php<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   essentially, somebody else is quite willing to dispute your point 1.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yeah, the implementations are all crap<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  IE can't do Digest on URIs that have query parameters<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  as I've learned from you, Digest could have been substantially simplified by removing 'options'<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   notes that you are about to propose an 'option' for the introspection file<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   got a uri for auth-int?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc2617.txt<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  search for the second instance of auth-int<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   ok, apparently auth-int involves a signature. That's important.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   I didn't see that in your implementation.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  we didn't do that in our impl, remember it's a server option in Digest<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yeah, for auth-int the whole body is used in addtion to the other parameters to calculated the digest<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   If you want to compare options, WSSE has more options than digest. An no, that's not a good thing.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   without signatures, there is essentially no man in the middle protection<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   with all the options, what you end up with the need to publish your policies (essentially, an introspection file). Here's an example:<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   http://edocs.bea.com/workshop/docs81/doc/en/core/index.html<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  Digest has other MitM preventions also, for example the server Authenticates itself to the client proving that it knows the secret too<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   all the man in the middle has to do is lie in wait until the client sends the final request.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   simple if check<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ?<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   scenario (in slow motion):<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   client sends a series of get requests<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   man in the middle lets them through<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   client sends a put request<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   path 1 (no server challenge):<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   man in the middle intercepts that message. It never gets sent. It sends a different body.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   client can notice this... this isn't simple passive. It also only allows one message. But it is a valid hole.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   path 2 (involves a server challenge):<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   client sends a POST request. Man in the midddle can't do much with it. It is incomplete.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   man in the middle stymied? Not exactly...<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   All it needs is to get the client to respond to a challenge that the server will accept.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   And in order to do that, all it needs to do is to get the server to provide such a challenge.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   Fortunately, the server is programmed to exactly that.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   So what does the man in the middle need to do?<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   Simple: allow the message through.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   the server will issue a challenge.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   the client will respond.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   the man in the middle intercepts THAT message<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   simple if check<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   meanwhile, the client has a false sense of security. Surely the overhead of the challenge and additional nonces provided SOME security, right?<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   effectively, all that has been done is to raise the bar from somebody who can play games with DNS and routers to somebody who can play games with DNS and routers AND do an if check.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   now, signing XML messages is another topic, and a lengthy one.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   the short answer is that it is harder than you think.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  agreed, with out auth-int, a MitM attack can change the request or response body<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   or more generally, signatures.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   signatures are very computationally expensive. And require the entire message to be in memory. They can't be done post SAX processing on the recipient side unless you do some complex normalization.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yes, but they have been eschewed traditionally as too computationally expensive, which is why they're optional in Digest, (expensive at the time the spec was released)<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  heheh<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   they STILL are computationally expensive. By design.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   The lock on a bank vault is harder to pick than the lock on my front door.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  for the size messages we are talking about sha(body) isn't prohibitively expensive<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  sha1 of a halfmeg text file is almost instantaneous on my 700MHz machine<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  is looking for Python perf measurement tools<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   before you do that, can we talk about how BULU would handle this?<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   I'm not familiar with bulu's internals.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ok<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   it is a CGI, right?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yes<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   it hands the stdin to the xml parser?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  yes<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   how would you compute the sha hash?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  content = stdin.read()<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  if check_auth(content, other headers....):<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  dispatch(content, headers)<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   step one is to read the entire megapixel image of grandma into memory...<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  it's already in memory<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   it doesn't need to be<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  since it came in via HTTP<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   sax can read the message from the stream as it comes in<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   overlapping cpu and i/o is a big win.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   important if you are a server serving lots of clients<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ok, good point, either use SAX, or initially stream stdin to a temporary file<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  but that kinda kills doing sha1(body)<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   the irony is that the people who need security the most (big server farms) have the fewest good options available.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   there are good people who have looked into this. Their conclusions roughly can be stated thus:<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   auth-int can be improved, and should be for the people who really need such security<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   auth without auth-int provides essentially nothing over simpler protocols that actually have less implementation and runtime costs and exposures.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   note: signatures CAN be done post SAX, but that requires some form of canonicalization.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  doesn't want to go anywhere near canonicalization..<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   ignorable whitespace, unicode, order of attributes, etc.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ok, I can agree with this: "auth without auth-int provides essentially nothing over simpler protocols that actually have less implementation and runtime costs and exposures."<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  so where does that leave us?<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  either use an auth that requires auth-int and possibly take a hit when TypePad users upload all their pictures<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  or use something like WSSE, which I would still prefer to be in the headers and not in the body<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   What you describe as WSSE is simply one profile of WSSE.<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   What we are talking about is WSSE Username Token.<br />
<span class="speakerA">jcgregorio</span>  ok<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   The mapping that you and Mark did of that profile to HTTP headers was good work. My only quibble is that it shouldn't be called "WSSE WSSE".<br />
<span class="speakerB">rubys</span>   It should be called something like "WSSE UsernameToken". Leaving the door open to WSSE Kerberous, etc.<br />
<br />

    When you guys talk signatures, you're deliberately leaving out HMAC, right? Why?

    Rich,<br />
  The conversation was solely about Digest and WSSE Username Token, but thanks for the pointer to HMAC. It appears to be an interesting approach that removes the computation concern, if computing a hash of the body is considered too expensive.

    Based on my experience, authentication problems are more easily solved using multiple solutions, each addressing a range of use cases with acceptable cost/benefit ratio, instead of forcing a single solution for all use cases.

    <p>Please don't do this yourselves. If you are creating a new protocol, please using an existing authentication scheme OR ask for help on sci.crypt or something similar. Ask a high-profile cryptologist that'll do it just for the creds.</p>
<p>I suggest TLS, which is well tested, works, and is already well integrated with web products such as browsers etc.</p>

  If I was actually inventing a new protocol I would do exactly what you suggest. But if you actually read the article you'd see that we are using Digest authentication as it was designed. The only thing that has changed are some minor shifts in the headers that carry the information.
