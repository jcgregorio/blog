title: RESTLog Interface Specification
date: 2003-01-06T12:00:00-05:00
---

  
  <p>The RESTLog interface is defined in <a href="#RESTLogInterface">Table 1</a>. The 
table lists the URLs, the verbs that can act on those locations,
the mime-type of the content and a description of the results
of that action. 
</p>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> The URL <code>RESTLog.cgi</code> is used as a placeholder for
the implementations <em>real</em> URL. For example, the real URL could easily be 
<code>http://bitworking/RESTLog.py</code> or <code>http://WellFormedWeb/news</code>.
The RESTLog interface does not define <em>what</em> the URL is, instead it defines
the actions that are allowed on that URL and the format of the responses. For example,
I can hand you a URL such as <code>http://bitworking.org/stories</code> and tell you that it conforms
to the RESTLog interface and you can perform, modulo security restrictions, all of 
the actions listed below on that URL.

    The HTTP verbs that can operate on the given URL. HTTP
    defines a standard set of verbs and we are only using
    a subset of them here.</dd>
<dt id="type_defn">Type</dt><dd>
    Type is just a shorthand for the mime-type of that 
    transaction. Normally selecting the mime type is handled through content
    negotiation for GETs and specified in the Content-Type for 
    PUTs and POSTs. Content-type can also be forced on a GET
    by appending a ?Type to any URL. For example, a link
    to the RSS file would be <code>/RESTLog.cgi?rss</code>.</dd>

<h3 id="format" name="format"><a href="#format">Format</a></h3>
<p>All the actions that deal with content type 'xml' are transporting items. Items are formatted 
as 'item' elements from <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss2">RSS 2.0</a>. The items
must additionally conform to the <a href="http://www.mplode.com/tima/archives/000126.html">RSS 2.0/XSS-extensible profile</a>
with the exception of defining the default namespace. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code>&lt;item xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;My Summer Vacation&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;On my summer vacation I went to...&lt;/description&gt;

      &lt;link&gt;http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/RESTLog.py/4&lt;/link&gt;
      &lt;dc:date&gt;2002-10-28T22:18:53-05:00&lt;/dc:date&gt;
&lt;/item&gt; </code></pre>
</div>
<p>
This example shows only a minimal number of elements. An implementation must no reject modules
it doesn't know about, though it is free to ignore them.</p>
<p>Further note that the contents of the 'item' element are guided
   by the <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS 2.0 specification</a>, which states that all elements are
   optional, but requires that at least one of 'title' or 'description' are present.
</p>
<h3 name="usage" id="usage"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h3>
<p>
To create a new item on the weblog the publishing client would format the 
new item as an 'item' element of RSS 2.0
and POST that to the URL <code>RESTLog.cgi</code>. GET, PUT and DELETE 
on the URL <code>RESTLog.cgi/<em>itemID</em></code> are used to 
manipulate an individual item. The client software can do a GET to
retrieve the most recent version of the XML for the item to be displayed
for editing by the user. After the user had edited the item it can be
PUT back and the items content will be replaced with the PUT copy.
Removing an item completely can be done by doing a DELETE on the
URL.</p>
<p>
Currently most (none?) of the news aggregators don't do content negotiation, so
you will need to feed them the URL <code>/RESTLog.cgi?rss</code> which they
can use to get the RSS feed.

<dd>Added some anchors and started removing content negotiation. 
       After using content negotiation in the field for a while it just seems to cause more trouble
       than it's worth. Many agents do not send 'accept' headers along. This causes
       problems with validators, transformation agents (like XSLT Services) and 
       possibly buggy browsers. A good rule of thumb I learned from this 
       exercise is "One mime-type per URL".
