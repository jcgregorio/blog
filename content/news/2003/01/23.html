  <p>I mentioned <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/21">last Friday</a> that
  I wouldn't mind seeing a more resilient form of XML. Now if we take that
  more resilient form of XML, mix it with 
  Mark's liberal RSS parser and Sam Ruby's Coping with Change and throw in 
  a dash of REST what do you have? Could these be the building blocks of phenotropic computing?
</p>
<p>Phenotropic Computing is the active area of research of <a href="http://people.advanced.org/~jaron/">Jaron Lanier</a>
  who talks about the idea in the interview <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2003/01/lanier_qa1.html">Coding from Scratch</a> 
  [found via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104369/2003/01/27.html#a324">Jon Schull</a>].
</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of a Google trail that led me from Jaron Lanier to 
David Gelernter to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/fflifestreams.html?topic=&amp;topic_set=">LifeStreams</a>, which
has a very RESTful architecture, including 5 verbs: Find, Squish, New, Clone, and Transfer.
