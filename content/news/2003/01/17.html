on a business trip at the beginning of February.
Hopefully this time the trip will go better than
my last <a href="http://bitworking.org/Sep2002.html#X631685978128512061">whirl-wind tour</a>.
I hope to at least have time to visit the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">Museum of Science and Industry</a> which
has come highly recommended.

<p>The original photograph that I used to
mock up my wintery walk in Chicago is from 
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ndlpcoop/ichihtml/cdnhome.html">Photographs from the Chicago Daily News, 1902-1933</a>,
part of the 
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">American Memory</a> section of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library
of Congress</a>. In particular I started with <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?cdn:3:./temp/~ammem_JMGp:"> Image of Alderman Joseph Badenoch, viewed from the side, walking along a residential street covered in snow in Chicago, Illinois.</a>
