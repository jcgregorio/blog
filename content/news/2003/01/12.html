  <p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1116.html">Sam Ruby</a> has found
a simpler method of implementing
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/20.html#automatic_linkbacks">Mark Pilgrim's Automatic Linkbacks</a> by
following the ant trail back through his referrer logs
to the calling web page and finally into the 
RSS file via the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#important_change_to_the_link_tag">link tag</a>.
Oooh, the stigmeric power of the Well-Formed Web.</p>
