  <p>This <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/htmls_time_is_over_lets_move_on.php" title="HTML's Time is Over. Let's Move On.">article on boxesandarrows</a> is a mostly flamebait and I 
should avoid commenting on it. But I can't resist.
First he constraints his argument to a mythical universe where 
SVG, MathML, SMIL, and XForms don't exist. Then says since he
can't do everything he wants to in that tiny realm the
only alternative is to go with proprietary technologies.
His excuses include:</p>
<dl><dt>Bandwidth</dt>
<dd>Sorry, there's no way in hell your
   JavaScript and CSS, which should be in seperate files and 
   cached on the client, even come close to the size of image files. 
   And even if they are turn on mod_gzip and they'll skrink to a third of their current size. </dd>
<dt>Accessibility</dt>
<dd>You can't be seriously putting Flash, Curl or Java up
  against HTML for accessibility.</dd>
<dt>Where is the application?</dt>
<dd>This sounds like a lame excuse for poor design. Especially, given this quote:
  <q>Users also insist on being able to use a ~Back~ button, which can cause page and 
     link management issues, especially if you are trying to use frames to solve other problems.
  </q> 
  Frames? Fretting about users using the back button? This is ludicrous.
  </dd>
<dt>Accessing the desktop</dt>
<dd>He does have a very minor point here on uploading 
   files being a pain, but everything else is a security nightmare.
   
   Of couse if you followed good RESTian principles in the design
   of your system you could have a standalone thin client that 
   does the uploading for the users that need it while still presenting
   the web interface to the rest of the users, with no change to the backend.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, I feel much better now. We return you to your regularly
scheduled programming.</p>
