title: Caching HTTP Requests in Python using httpcache.py

  <p>I really like <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>. The more I work with the language
the more I like it. It has a nice clean syntax and a 
very nice set of standard libraries. In particular
it has a wide range of web <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/lib.html">libraries</a>, from low-level
sockets, to cgi processing, to a library for connecting to an IMAP server, it
has it all. It even has three libraries
for pulling content off the web, httplib, urllib and urllib2. If
you know you are going to just be pulling information
over http then you can use <a href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-httplib.html">httplib</a>,
which acts as a web client. One of the omissions
in httplib that I noticed was that it does not handle
compressed content, nor does it cache results, nor does
it use ETags to avoid retrieving files that haven't
changed since the last time you requested them. I have worked
with RSS news aggregators and seen the dramatic performance gains
that these features provide. Thus I give you <a href="/projects/httpcache/">httpcache.py</a>.
It does all that, and a little bit more.
</p>
<p>The little bit more is a little meta-data thing.
That is, when I store the content from the URL in
the cache, I also store all the headers that I 
received when I pulled that file. In addition httpcache.py provides
a way to add and/or update the values of the headers
stored in the cache. This gives a nice clean place to 
store meta-data for that content. </p>
<p id="python_ess_ref">For Python, the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710910/bitworking-20">Python Essential Reference (2nd Edition)</a>
is my constant companion. If you already know another programming language
then this is the only Python book you will need to get up and running.
It contains a quick tutorial section, basic language reference, and then
covers <em>most</em> of the libraries that come standard with Python. I empahasized
most, because it doesn't cover any of the XML libraries, instead referring you
to another book that just covers XML for Python.</p>
<p><strong>14-May-2003</strong> An updated version has been posted. This fixes the coversion of the md5 hash into a string by 
   dropping the redundant '0x's. It also fixes gzip support and adds another unit test case.</p>
<p><strong>21-Oct-2004</strong> <a href="/projects/httpcache/">Httpcache.py now has it's own project page</a>. Go there 
 for downloads and the latest news.</p>

    and its one of the best all around references I've read. Its also a bit smaller so it's easier to carry around. 

BTW - Joe - embedding HTML into text here seems to cut off the comments.

    It does appear to be. I will look at the transformation code.

    I was going to have to build a cache for a Python version of Stapler. At this rate I'll only have to glue the right parts together. Hmmm!

    Cool. Glad my code could be of use.

    Did you ever notice problems with fetching gzipped resources? I keep seeing this error:

http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/python-Tutor/1537279

when fetching a particular URL ( http://www.wigu.com/ ), because gzip.GzipFile tries to tell() the "file-like" object.

    Mark,
   I have updated the code and posted the new version. Let me know if this fixes the problem.
