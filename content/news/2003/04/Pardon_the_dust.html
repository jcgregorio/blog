title: Pardon the dust

  <p>Please pardon the dust while I re-arrange
some content on the site. It has become 
rather bothersome to have a /news and a 
/story installation of Bulu, and now that
I have a single-post-per-page CMS working
I find I don't need a seperate blog for stories.
So those stories are moving up to /news 
and a .htaccess has been put in place to redirect
requests to their new home. Expect the same changes
over at <a href="http://wellformedweb.org">The Well-Formed Web</a></p>
