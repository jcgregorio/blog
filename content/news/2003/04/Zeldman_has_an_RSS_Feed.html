  <p>To quote the man himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bowing to demand, or maybe just as an experiment, 
   we've hand rolled an <a href="http://zeldman.com/feed/zeldman.xml">RSS feed</a> for this site. 
   It appears to <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http://www.zeldman.com/feed/zeldman.xml">validate</a>. 
   Let us know if you have any problems with it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is great for several reasons. First, because I really like Zeldman's writing. Second, because I thought he
   would never do it (I'm apparently <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/24/zeldman_has_an_rss_feed.html#c001512">not the only one</a>).
   And lastly, because just the day before he published <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0403a.shtml#unsyndicate">a long and breezy entry</a>
   on why RSS just wasn't right for his type of content and that he would never supply an RSS feed. You gotta love that laid back attitude.</p>

    I've had a RSS feed for Zeldman for awhile:  http://services.perceive.net/xml/zeldman_rss10.xml

    um... hrm... joe you're link throws a 404 and eric you're link blows chunks with the xml, at least in IE. ;) joe you need to change your link from bitworking.org to zeldman.com. here's the correct link.
