  <p><a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/37">Bulu 0.93</a> has now been deployed 
   across all my sites. It sports two new features.
   The first is the ability to dislay only an excerpt
   on the main page. (A feature I have come to appreciate on <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray's blog</a>.)</p>
  <p>The other new feature is the URL generation. The older
   versions of Bulu generated incrementing numeric ids for
   the posts. That makes for extremely forgettable URLs
   so the new version creates an item URL using a munged up
   version of the items title. For example, the URL of this 
   post, under the old Bulu would have been:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>http://bitworking.org/news/81</code></pre>
<p>Now under 0.93 it is:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>http://bitworking.org/news/Bulu_0_93_Now_Deployed</code></pre>
<p>The last, and probably best new feature is the comments tracking. 
Bulu now generates an <a href="http://bitworking.org/comments.rss">RSS feed for the last 20 comments</a>, and 
an <a href="http://bitworking.org/comments.html">HTML page with the last 20 comments</a>, both of 
which are my favorite features of <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog">Sam Ruby's mombo</a>.</p>
