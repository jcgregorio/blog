  <p><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/" title="The worlds ugliest standards web site.">ECMA</a> 
   is updating ECMAScript (JavaScript to you and me), with enhancements for 
   XML [via <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1297.html">Sam Ruby</a>]. 

   <abbr title="ECMAScript for XML">E4X</abbr> is based on 
   <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/articles/JSchneider_XML.jsp" title="Native XML Scripting in BEA WebLogic Workshop">
   BEAs extensions to ECMAScript in BEA WebLogic Workshop</a>.   
   The 
   <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/articles/JSchneider_XML.jsp" title="Native XML Scripting in BEA WebLogic Workshop">
   BEA article</a> points out the akwardness and verbosity of DOM for manipulating XML, which
   is something I am fond of harping on. Then it goes on to explain the extensions to ECMAScript for
   manipulating XML, the here I would like to emphasize the word <strong>extensions</strong>, as 
   they are not just adding in a new API, but instead are adding in new syntax to the core
   language for XML. Preferring syntax over an API or object-model is something I cover
   in <a href="http://bitworking.org/story/5">Language-Centric Software Development</a>
