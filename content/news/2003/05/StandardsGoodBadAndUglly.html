title: Standards The Good, The Bad And The Uglly

  <p>Over the past week or two there has been a lot to chew on in
   the realm of standards.</p>
  <p>One of the big items was Tim Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/21/RDFNet">post on RDF</a>,
   which is interesting for a couple of reasons, the first being a great quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's the Syntax, Stupid!</p></blockquote>
<p>It is also nice for me to see other people question RDF. As <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2003/05/23.html">Ziv points out</a>, we spent
   a lot of time last September <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2002/09/11.html">questioning</a> the utility 
   of RDF, specifically the <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000528.htm#comment2034">utility of RDF in RSS 1.0</a>. It's great to see 
   Tim challenging the RDF community on a much broader base.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs">Jim Waldo</a> asks <a href="">Why Standards?</a>, which
   echoes the a common refrain of mine, that standards are what you do after the innovation
   is done. It also seems to mirror Tim Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/10/RSS-std">thoughts on standards</a>.</p>
<p>So, let the market inovate, then define a standard based on what the market has decided. 
   HTTP is a good example of that, and <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1278.html">Simon Fell</a> asks why all of the blogging APIs, except <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/5">RESTLog</a>,
   don't use the native authentication mechanisms of HTTP. On the flip-side, filtering Spam using 
   the Bayesian Chain Rule is an example of the speed of development <strong>outside</strong>
   standards committees. Remember, Paul Graham's article <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">A Plan For Spam</a> was only published 
   last August, and Bayesian spam filtering is already incorporated into the Mozilla mail client
   and more toolkits are appearing regularly, now the meme is jumping pools 
   and <img src="http://john.beimler.org/favicon.ico" alt="Joh Beimler" title="The first man to fit his visage into a favicon." /><a href="http://john.beimler.org/serval_aggregator_first_post.html">John Beimler</a> is talking about using 
   Bayesian techniques for filtering <em>up</em> interesing posts from his RSS subscriptions. When I jump
   into the deep end of this pool, <a href="http://crm114.sourceforge.net/">CRM114</a> will probably be my first stop.</p>
<p>Not to forget that there's a real world outside of computers, we are still exploring
   replacement cameras for our dead Olympus, and once I get back to taking more
   photos, even if I don't go into a <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2003_05.shtml#001229">Starbucks</a>, I'll make sure I always have a handy copy of the <a href="http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm">Legal Handbook for Photographers</a> [via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/05/030526your_rights_.html">Kottke.org</a>].</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing, <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com">Lambda the Ultimate</a> rocks. Very few sites
   can match their consistent quality of posts or commentary on languages and language design.</p>
