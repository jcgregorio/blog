  <p><a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/20/PrintArchives">Tim Bray</a> weighs in
   on the current Google/NYTimes flap by pointing out that he thinks the reason
   the publishers haven't put their archives on the web is because they are getting 
   a good revenue stream from selling them to <a href="http://www.dialog.com/">Dialog</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>But bear in mind that these are businesses. 
  They'll make the move when, and only when, the money says to. 
  Abstractions like Web Citizenship are not part of the equation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately that's just not a believable angle, especially given this 
   <a href="http://www.longbets.org/2">long bet</a>
   between Dave Winer and Martin Nisenholtz, the CEO of The New York Times Digital.
   Yes, the CEO of The New York Times Digital bet $1,000 against Dave Winer that in a 
   Google search of five keywords or phrases representing the top five news stories 
   of 2007, weblogs will rank higher than the New York Times' Web site. This, at the 
   same time the NYTimes robots.txt file completely forbids Google to spider
   the NYTimes web site. I think this calls for a modified form 
   of <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/HanlonsRazor.html">Hanlon's Razor</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never attribute to good business sense that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.</p></blockquote>
