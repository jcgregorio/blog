  <blockquote><p> At my Washington office a few weeks ago, I met with a 
   visiting Japanese parliamentarian who specializes in science and 
   technology issues. I related to him my belief that the Chinese 
   would be on the moon within a decade with a declaration of permanent 
   occupation. He disagreed. He smiled and said my conclusion was 
   accurate but my timing was off. In his view, the Chinese would 
   be on the moon within three to four years. [<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20030528-092308-4284r.htm">Editorial, Robert S. Walker, The Washington Times</a>]

<p>There is a great short story by <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Literature/Authors/L/Lem,_Stanislaw/?il=1">Stanislaw Lem</a>,
   the title of which now eludes me, where bureaucracy is used as a weapon. That is, a giant bureaucracy is 
   erected to engage the enemy. It grows and grows and eventually wears down the enemy. In the 
   end the victor takes the bureaucracy and hurls it into the sun, feeling that the universe wouldn't 
   be safe with such a powerful weapon around. </p>
