  <p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/05/14#When:5:41:34AM">Dave's</a> <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stories/storyReader$355">pictures from Dartmouth</a> summarize perfectly why
   I left there. It is mid-May and there only the first beginnings
   of leaves on the trees in Hanover, which makes me think it must be a milder spring than normal. I remember sitting
   at one graduation ceremony at <a href="http://www.colby-sawyer.edu/">Colby-Sawyer College</a> in the first week
   of June and there being less leaves on the trees than in Dave's pictures. Just miserablly cold weather for 
   far too much of the year, and yes, I am allowed to complain, since I did do something about it. I moved to North Carolina.</p>
