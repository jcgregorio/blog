  <p>Stigmergy, communicating through the environment, plays a major role
   in organizing ant colony behaviour. Most of that stigmeric communication is done
   through scents, and most of the examples of stigmeric communication I mention in 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Stigmergy">Stigmergy and the World-Wide Web</a> are examples
   where the scent is in the static physical environment, that is, in the mud in the walls of the nest
   and on the ground on an ant trail. Now researchers at 
   <a href="http://ant.stanford.edu/labpeople.htm">The Gordon Lab</a> at Stanford have discovered that
   ants performing differing tasks smell differently, and that the ant behaviour changes
   in the face of collections of ants with particular scents. This is just another example of stigmergy, even though the scent is on the other ants it is not direct communication
   from ant to ant, as only a group of ants with the same smell will trigger a new behaviour in the ants.

<p>It makes sense from an  evolutionary point of view, that is, if you have a successful strategy, keep re-using 
   it for maximum effect. In other words, even in nature, if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 
   There is more detail in the Stanford press release
