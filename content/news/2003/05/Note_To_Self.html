  <p>I was installing <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/6">Bulu</a> on a new machine and kept coming up 
with an Internal Server Error when trying to run the script.
Now I have previously installed this under Windows and Linux
so I was sure I had the permissions correct. Little did I know
that the server I was installing on had suExec turned on. Turns out
my permissions were <em>too</em> liberal and that is what was generating
the error.</p>
