   has been covering the 
   whining, by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/weekinreview/18NUNB.html">NY Times</a> and the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30087.html">Register</a>, about blogs biasing Google. This is familiar stuff, and I 
   might point out, I covered almost a year ago in <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Heisenberg_and_Google">Google and Heisenberg</a>.
   It looks like their <a href="http://bitworking.org/Aug2002.html#X631645341782902800">robots.txt file hasn't changed</a> in that time either.</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    Their robots.txt file is hilarious.
