  What to do when it&#39;s late at night and your high schooler says his table
  wasn&#39;t able to complete their physics lab today because they were missing
  equipment, and the teacher said, maybe half jokingly, that they could complete
  the lab at home if they didn&#39;t finish it in class? That&#39;s right, you
  build experimental equipment in your garage.

  This is the
  <a href="http://www.arborsci.com/inertial-balance">Interial Balance</a> we
  built from scratch using two hacksaw blades. It took about about 20 minutes to
  build and then another 10 to actually run the experiment.

  I hope we don't have to "junkyard wars" all of his labs, but this was fun and
  quick to build.
