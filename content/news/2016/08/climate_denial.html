  >, extended to the full seven stages:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Stage 1: Denial</dt>
  <dd>Pre 2010 - The climate is not changing.</dd>
  <dt>Stage 2: Ignorance</dt>
  <dd>
    2010 - The climate might be changing, or it might not, we just don&#39;t
    know.
  </dd>
  <dt>Stage 3: GAIA Bashing</dt>
  <dd>2014 - Climate change is real, but itâ€™s natural.</dd>
  <dt>Stage 4: We so tiny</dt>
  <dd>
    2016 - Climate change is real, but humans aren&#39;t the primary cause.
  </dd>
  <dt>Stage 5: We so poor</dt>
  <dd>
    2018 - OK, humans are the primary cause, but we can&#39;t afford to do
    anything about it.
  </dd>
  <dt>Stage 6: Acceptance</dt>
  <dd>
    2020 - This is awful, why didn&#39;t you tell us it would be this bad!?!?
  </dd>
  <dt>Stage 7: Revert to Form</dt>
  <dd>2024 - We would have fixed the climate if it wasn&#39;t for Obama.</dd>
