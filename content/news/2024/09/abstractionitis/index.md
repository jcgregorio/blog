To summarize, the author of a web framwork that tries to abstract how the author
_thinks_ a browser works, is complaining about the amount of work it takes to
conform their abstraction to how a browser **actually** works. 

To the author, a sufferer of the condition I refer to as _abstractionitis_, I
offer this for all their woes, a tiny unicode violin: <small>ðŸŽ»<small>.
