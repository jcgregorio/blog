I am providing a text version of Bernie's statement here, because all I could
find online were images posted to various social media sites.

I'm also posting this because it needs to be seen, Bernie is right.

> It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has
> abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned
> them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is the Latino and
> Black workers as well.
>
> While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people
> are angry and want change. And they're right.
>
> Today, while the very rich are doing phenomenally well, 60% of Americans live
> paycheck to paycheck and we have more income and wealth inequality than ever
> before. Unbelievably, real, inflation-accounted-for weekly wages for the
> average American worker are actually lower now than they were 50 years ago.
>
> Today, despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity, many young
> people will have a worse standard of living than their parents. And many of
> them worry that Artificial Intelligence and robotics will make a bad situation
> even worse.
>
> Today, despite spending far more per capita than other countries, we remain
> the only wealthy nation not to guarantee health care to all as a human right
> and we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
> We, alone among major countries, cannot even guarantee paid family and medical
> leave.
>
> Today, despite strong opposition from a majority of Americans, we continue to
> spend billions funding the extremist Netanyahu government's all out war
> against the Palestinian people which has led to the horrific humanitarian
> disaster of mass malnutrition and the starvation of thousands of children.
>
> Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the
> Democratic Party learn any real lessons from his disaster campaign? Will they
> understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of
> Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on
> the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political
> power? Probably not.
>
> In the coming weeks and months those of concerned about grassroots democracy
> and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions.
>
> Stay tuned.
