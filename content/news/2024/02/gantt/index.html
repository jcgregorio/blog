  <p>
    In the field of Project Management there are different chart types used to
    analyze a project, such as timelines, PERT charts, and Gantt charts. This
    article provides a solid mathematical basis for describing such charts and
    then uses that to categorize the most common types of charts based on their
    mathematical properties.
  </p>
</aside>

<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    There are many types of charts used for project planning, but in general
    they display a project as a series of tasks, where the duration of each task
    is displayed as a horizontal bar, where the left hand edge of the task bar
    is aligned with the time at which that task will start. Charts may also
    contain dependencies among the tasks, which can also be displayed on the
    chart.
  </p>
  <p>
    The names for such charts are used inconsistently. For example, Fig 1 is an
    example Gantt chart produced by Microsoft Project.
  </p>

      red, the slack is the black lines connected to non-critical activities.

  <p>
    Other Gantt charts lack dependencies between the tasks being tracked, like
    in the spreadsheet based chart in Fig. 2.

    Finally there are PERT charts that don't use the bar presentation and
    instead present a network diagram of task dependencies.

  <h2>Defining Characteristics</h2>
  <p>
    All the charts share some consistent features, for example using arrows to
    denote dependencies between the tasks. Some charts use the width of the task
    to show its duration. Also note that we use the diamond shapes to indicate
    milestones, which are 0 duration tasks. All charts have an implicit or
    explicit start and finish milestones.
  </p>

      A simple chart of two tasks A and B, and two milestones, S for start, and
      F for finish. The flow is S -> A -> B -> F.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A task can have muliple predecessors (F) and can have multiple descendents
    (A).

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure N.</strong>
      A simple chart of three tasks A, B, and C. There are also two milestones,
      S for start, and F for finish. The flow is S -> A -> B -> F and A -> C ->
      F.

  <h2>Chart</h2>
  <p>
    A chart is a tuple consisting of an ordered list of Tasks and then a set of
    Relations between Tasks. In the nomenclature of Graph Theory, the Tasks will
    be the vertexes and the Relations will be the edges in the graph.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>A chart is a tuple of Tasks and Relations.</dt>
      <dd>$$ C=(T,R) $$</dd>
      <dt>
        Tasks is an ordered list of Tasks. Note that this is different from the
        basic definition of a Graph where the vertexes are just a set and don't
        have any specific ordering. The ordering here allows algorithms run over
        the chart to be deterministic, and can also be used when displaying
        charts.
      </dt>
      <dd>$$ T=[T_0, T_1, T_2, ...] $$</dd>
      <dt>Each Task has a duration:</dt>
      <dd>$$ T_{i}.d $$</dd>
      <dt>Relations is a list of Relations.</dt>
      <dd>$$ R=[R_0, R_1, R_2, ...] $$</dd>
      <dt>
        Where each Relation is a tuple, where \(i\) and \(j\) are indexes into
        the Task list, and \(a\), \(b\) and \(l\) are arguments to the
        expression that determines a constraint on the start time of \( T_j \).
      </dt>
      <dd>
        $$ R_k=\{(i, j, a, b, l) \mid i, j \in ℕ \; {\textrm {and}} \; a, b \in
        \{0,1\} \; {\textrm {and}} \; l \in ℝ \}$$
      </dd>
      <dt>The start constraint formula is below.</dt>
      <dd>
        $$ {\textrm {start_constraint}}(R_k) = \textrm{start}(i) + a * T_{i}.d -
        b * T_{j}.d + l $$
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In many Gantt packages you can set the constriaint on a task as a
      relationship between either the Start or the Finish of each task. These
      relative positions are called Start-To-Start, Start-To-Finish,
      Finish-To-Finish, and Finish-To-Start. We can map that values of \(a\) and
      \(b\) to the relative positions. We will presume \(l=0\) and just
      concentrate on the function of \(a\) and \(b\).
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        If both tasks should begin at the same time then we set \(a=0\) and
        \(b=0\), this corresponds to the Start-To-Start positioning.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        $$ {\textrm {start_constraint}} = \textrm{start}(i) + 0 * T_{i}.d - 0 *
        T_{j}.d + 0 = \textrm{start}(i) $$
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <figure>
      <img src="./SS.png" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure N.</strong> If both tasks should begin at the same time
        then we set \(a=0\) and \(b=0\). This is referred to as a Start-To-Start
        constraint, or SS for short.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>You can see how the values of \(a\) and \(b\) map to constraints:</p>
