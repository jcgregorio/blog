  <p>
    In the field of Project Management there are different chart types used to
    analyze a project, such as timelines, PERT, and Gantt charts. These
    different types of charts lack crisp mathematical definitions and thus it's
    not possible to categorize such charts or discuss their capabilities with
    any precision. This article provides a solid mathematical basis for
    describing such charts and then categorizes the most common types of charts
    based on their mathematical properties.
