  <p>
    In the field of Project Management there are different chart types used to
    analyze a project, such as timelines, PERT charts, and Gantt charts. This
    article provides a solid mathematical basis for describing such charts and
    then uses that to categorize the most common types of charts based on their
    mathematical properties.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    There are many types of charts used for project planning, but in general
    they display a project as a series of tasks, where the duration of each task
    is displayed as a horizontal bar, where the left hand edge of the task bar
    is aligned with the time at which that task will start. Charts may also
    contain dependencies among the tasks, which can also be displayed on the
    chart.
  </p>
  <p>
    The names for such charts are used inconsistently. For example, Fig 1 is an
    example Gantt chart produced by Microsoft Project.

      red, the slack is the black lines connected to non-critical activities.

    Other Gantt charts lack dependencies between the tasks being tracked, like
    in the spreadsheet based chart in Fig. 2.

    Finally there are PERT charts that eschew the bar presentation and instead
    present a network diagram of task dependencies.
