    <p>The <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/>Google API Client for Python</a>
    is now considered in Alpha, which means that while it may still blow up, destroy data, and eat 
    small kittens, I will be more surprised by such results, and less likely to say that it's a known
    issue. Any and all feedback you have on the library will be greatly appreciated, either via 
    the <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/google-api-python-client>discussion group</a> or 
    the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/issues/list>issue tracker</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Just to reprise the current status, through the magic of discovery, the
    client library now supports the Buzz, Moderator, Latitude, Custom Search,
    Diactize, Translate, and Prediction APIs.
    </p>
    <p>And yes, before you say it, I do owe you a blog post on the new discovery document and how it 
    compares to WADL and how I'm not a hypocrite, but that is in process and not quite ready yet.
    </p>
