    <p>
    XML namespaces are designed to provide distributed extensibility 
    using URIs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Distributed extensibility means that multiple people, or organizations, can 
    extend an XML format with out any communication between
    them, and if they follow the rules they will avoid syntactic collisions.
    That statement shouldn't be controversial, it's a 
    statement of fact, the definition of distributed extensibility.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The problem is that everyone seems to 
    accept the underlying assumption that distributed 
    extensibilty is a desirable property. 
    </p>

    <p>
    It isn't. 
    </p>

    <p>
    It seems like such a great idea, let a thousand flowers bloom, 
    and all that. And maybe, in a utopian world, where unicorns 
    fart butterflies, it might all work out, but back here 
    the real world, it just falls apart in a bunch of different ways. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The biggest problem with distributed extensibility is 
    that it's a solution to problem that doesn't exist. 
    The idea that you need a system where anyone, anywhere, 
    can add new extension element to an XML document without 
    consulting anyone, at anytime time, is just not a use case. 
    Let's look at Atom as an example; the feedvalidator currently only knows 
    about 80 extension namespaces. You don't need infinite 
    extensiblity to track 80 things. You need a napkin. 
    </p>

    <p>
    But let's put aside the mechanics, what are the social downsides 
    of distributed extensibility? 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you have distributed extensibilty then you 
    don't have to have anyone review the change you are proposing. 
    There's a reason why internally at Google we require that all code 
    get a code review before being checked in; it's important to get 
    another set of eyes on what you're doing. 
    The second downside to distributed extensibility is that 
    there isn't a single place to look for where extensions 
    are defined, which of course presumes they are even documented 
    to begin with. 
    </p>

    <p>
    So what are the alternatives? Fortunately there are several 
    examples of non-distributed extensibility. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Link relations in Atom are tracked in a 
    <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">central repository</a>. 
    Getting your link relation registered is a matter of <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-7.1>sending an email</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Another example is HTML5 link relations, in which case you just need 
    to <a href=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#other-link-types>edit a wiki page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Notice that both of the above systems address the social failings 
    of distributed extensibility by keeping a central repository and 
    providing for reviews of proposed extensions. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If I started today to build a new format I would build it on 
    JSON and not XML; but that's not terribly relevent to the discussion. 
    If I started today to build a format and was forced 
    into using XML, then I would not use namespaces as the 
    extensibility mechanism. Instead I would pick a single 
    namespace, and require extensions to use a registry type system 
    for extensions, like what was done for Atom or HTML5 link 
    relations. If you wanted to add an extension then you'd have to 
    propose the extension, either by email or editing a wiki page, 
    and then that would be added to the registry of all extensions 
    to the format. All extensions would then live in the one namespace 
    for the format.  I would also pick a URI for the sole namespace that looked 
    as little like an HTTP URI as possible, maybe use a urn:, or 
    do like WebDAV did and just make up a 4 character string: "DAV:" 
    </p>

    <p>
    And now the caveats. First, this isn't a post about HTML5. I know in
    the past there was a kerfuffle about distributed extensiblity in HTML5, but
    I stayed out of it, like I do with almost all discussion of HTML5.
    Also, this post is just about the concept of distributed extensibilty; I 
    have a whole other tirade about the mechanics of using URIs as the extension
    mechansim, which will be for another day.
