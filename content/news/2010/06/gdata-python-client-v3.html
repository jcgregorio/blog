    <p>I just pushed a prototype of what I'd like the 
    <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/gdata-python-client-library-contributors/browse_thread/thread/6b1bb990039ad34f>
      next version of the GData Python Client</a> to look like,
    along with a design document. Please send feedback
    to the <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/gdata-python-client-library-contributors>
    gdata python client library contributors mailing list</a>.</p>
