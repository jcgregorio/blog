    <blockquote><p>It is possible that we’ll see standardization of componentry
      around specific projects like Hadoop – although even that seems unlikely
      with the rampant proliferation of query, import and other ecosystem
      projects – but I do not expect to see a standard stack of software used
      to tackle generic Big Data problems, because there really aren’t many
      generic Big Data problems. Inconvenient as that might be from a
      vocabulary perspective.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Some dates for perspective, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>Codd's
      paper was published in 1970</a>, and the first public release of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL#Product_history>MySQL
      was in 1998</a>.

    It is still very early days, with the MapReduce paper only being published in 2004;
    presuming MapReduce is the one true abstraction you need, never mind <a href=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html>Dremel</a> 
    or <a href=http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/large-scale-graph-computing-at-google.html>Pregel</a>.
