    <p>
    Because, you know, I don't need to know about 
    lxml preserving the case of my doctype <b>every single time</b> I run <a href=http://code.google.com/p/piccolo-pub/>piccolo</a>.  </p>
    <pre class=prettyprint>import warnings
from html5lib.constants import DataLossWarning
warnings.simplefilter("ignore", DataLossWarning) 

from lxml import etree
    </pre>
