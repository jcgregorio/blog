    I was thrilled to see work begin on <a href=http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/>WebFinger</a>, particularly
    caught by the <a href=http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html>very simple premise of John Panzer in his
      description of the problem</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      <i>The Personal Web Discovery Problem</i>:  Given a person, how do I find out
      what services that person uses? </p>
    </blockquote> 
  
    <p>
      He breaks it down further by noting that the email address
      is a powerful personal identifier. That strikes me 
      as the core of what is needed, that is, a way to go from an email address
      to an HTTP URI. Once you get to a resource on the web all the good
      infrastruture in place kicks in, and you get hypertext, caching, 
      redirects, etags, etc. all 'for free' once you make that jump.
      </p>

    <p>
      Since then work has progressed on
      the <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger>WebFinger mailing list</a>
      and I stopped paying attention. My attention was brought
      back to it recently because of a conversation on 
      <a href=http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg11474.html>atom-protocol</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For something with such a very simple premise, what 
    exists now under the name WebFinger strikes me as 
    very large and complex solution with a lot of moving parts.
    The current proposed solution now involves URI Templates, the 
    XRD format (which involves signatures and thus Canonical XML), 
    the .well-known URI space, <a href=http://hueniverse.com/2009/08/making-the-case-for-a-new-acct-uri-scheme/>
      a new URI scheme: 'acct'</a>, and maybe even some DNS records.  
    </p>
    <p>I believe the solution can be much simpler:</p>
    <ol> 
      <li>Parse the email address into local-part and domain. 
      </li><li>Use the domain from the email address to construct the finger URI: 

       <pre><code>http://&lt;domain>/.well-known/finger</code></pre>

      </li><li> GET the JSON document at the finger URI. The body of the response will be a JSON 
           object:

          <pre><code>{
  "finger": "http://example.org/{local}"
}</code></pre>

                   The object has a key of 'finger', and the 
                   value at the key 'finger' is a string, a URI Template 
                   with a single variable: 'local'.

       </li><li> Substitue the local-name part of the email address for
                     the {local} part of the URI Template and expand the URI
                     Template.

       </li><li>Do a GET on the generated URI to retrieve a JSON document, a
       dictionary:

       <pre><code>{
  "OpenID": "http://...",
  "blog" : "http://bitworking.org",
  ...
}</code></pre>
</li></ol>
  
<p>You will note that there are no special DNS records used,
no XRD, no new URI scheme, and no Canonical XML. All the representations involved
are JSON. I don't see any reason to restrict what the
values are for the second dictionary, so the value of
'blog' could just as easily be an array of strings if there
was more than one:</p>
<pre class=prettyprint>{
  "OpenID": "http://...",
  "blog" : ["http://bitworking.org", "http://wellformedweb.org"]
  ...
}</pre>
       <p>Now the one thing you might point out is that 
       there could be conflicts over key names in the dictionary,
       but that could be easily resolved by having a simple wiki-based
       registration for keys, just like is done for <a href=http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions>'rel' extensions in
         HTML5</a>. That same registry could also document what the values
       for the key are expected to be. For example, the entry for 'blog' could
       explain that the value is a list of strings, where the strings are URIs.
       </p>
       <p>
       Even though this is extremely simple there are still two points
       of extensibiliity: adding new 'key' values to each of the two JSON objects 
       returned along the way.
       </p>
       <p>Ideas are fine, but code is better, so I started with DeWitt's previous
       working code and modified it to follow the above algorithm. The web interface
       is running at <a href=http://webfingerclient-jcgregorio.appspot.com/>http://webfingerclient-jcgregorio.appspot.com/</a>
       and the code, a branch of DeWitt's code, is available as <a href=http://code.google.com/r/joegregorio-webfingerclient/>http://code.google.com/r/joegregorio-webfingerclient/</a>.
       Kudos to DeWitt, it was his very clean code that make creating 
       this demo easy. The only address that supports the above algorithm
       right now is <code>joe@bitworking.org</code>.

       doesn't seem to have cleared the moderation queue yet.
