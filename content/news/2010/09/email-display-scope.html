    <blockquote><p>
      If you are building an installed application that uses OAuth, you may want to display the Email address of the user's Google Account.  To do this, you will need to modify the scope(s) you request via OAuth to include the following Email Display Scope:<br>
          https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo#email
      </p></blockquote>
      <p>A useful tidbit for which that site seems to be the only documentation.</p>
