    There are two things that have been bothering me for a while now.
    The first is that the only realistic way out of our current situation, 
    barring a Japan-like lost decade, is to inflate 
    our way out of the Great Recession, yet there isn't any movement 
    in that direction.
    </p>

    The other thing that has puzzled me has been the treatment
    of China as if it were an economic miracle, impervious to 
    any rational market behavior. As a general rule, claims
    of an "Economic Miracle" should be treated to the same scepticism
    as perpetual motion machines. There are rumblings, centered
    on bubble-like real-estate prices, that the China bubble is about
    to burst.
    </p>
    <p>
    And that leads me back to puzzle number one, and the idea
    that maybe the Fed does realize that it has to inflate us out
    of the Great Recession, but that it will be much easier to do
    <em>after</em> the wheels have come off the Chinese economy, and not 
    before.
