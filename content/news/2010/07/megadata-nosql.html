    <p>
    Do not get me wrong, I'm thrilled to see some of the
    ideas that <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData>I've talked about</a> finally getting traction
    in the wider community, and pleased that someone came up
    with a different name than Megadata, but in looking at
    many of the discussions it appears that there's way too 
    much focus on the "SQL" part of NoSQL. While breaking away 
    from looking at data merely in a relational manner is a good
    start, it misses the larger picture, which is that working 
    with Megadata, really large data sets, the nature of the problems
    and the nature of the solutions markedly changes.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the simplest of level you have to get beyond N=1 thinking, you
    can't possibly store all that data on one machine, nor can you
    hope to process it through one machine. Whatever software you
    build to house and handle all that data must be an 
    <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/218/N-1>N &gt; 1</a> endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
    But also missing is the idea that there are problems that are 
    <a href=http://vimeo.com/11928827>simpler to solve, or are only possible
      to solve, once you have enough data </a>. That brings me back to
    one of the most exciting annoucements at Google IO, which was the 
    <a href=http://code.google.com/apis/predict/>Prediction API</a>; in
    conjunction with <a href=http://code.google.com/apis/storage/>Google
      Storage for Developers</a> it puts the tools for leveraging Megadata into
    more hands.
    </p>
    <p>So I'm glad to see NoSQL getting traction, but I'm looking forward
    to the day when the discussion moves beyond what was left behind,
    and moves on to what new things we can build going forward.</p>
