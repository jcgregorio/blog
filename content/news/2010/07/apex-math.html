    <p>
    Lynne has her <a href=http://www.apex-math.com>Apex Math</a> site up and running.
    Having done teaching and tutoring for years she has strong opinions
    on how math is taught in schools today, and how it should be changed
    to help the students and give them a positive attitude about math.
    She's now taken that experience and put it into a set curriculum 
    for a whole range of grades and areas, from <a href=http://www.apex-math.com/products>K-2 to Algebra</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>She's put a lot of work into the business so far, not just creating
    the curriculum, but setting up the site, the <a href=http://www.apex-math.com/affiliates>affiliate program</a>,
    and recording videos. Two bigs helpers that have made the process easier have been
    <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=jcgregorio">webfaction</a> for hosting and 
    <a href=http://wordpress.com/>WordPress</a> for the content management.
