    <p>The <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/>Google
      API Client for Python</a> is a new project to implement a Python 
    client for discovery based APIs, which is currently
    Moderator, Buzz and Latitude. I had pointed out the 
    <a href=http://www.google.com/buzz/joe.gregorio/TRtzSEPFdVQ/http-www-googleapis-com-discovery-0-1-describe-api>
      existence of the discovery document back in May</a>, and the same
    caveats still apply, it is very early days and you should
    expect the format to change. On the other hand, having a discovery document
    as part of the web service itself greatly simplfies the code; the core 
    code is in apiclient/discovery.py and weighs in at less than 300 lines
    of code. That's not feature complete by any means, but take a look
    at <a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/source/browse/samples/cmdline/buzz.py>samples/cmdline/buzz.py</a>
    to see how easy it can be to interact with the Buzz APIs.
