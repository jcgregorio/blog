title:  The End of Stuff

    <p>The introduction of a computer into a house or business meant the introduction 
    of more stuff. Computer, monitor, cables, printer, etc. The whole
    "Paperless Office" thing was a sham, owning a computer meant even more
    paper than ever was printed and lying around. But recently that trend
    in our house has started to turn around. We're not actually moving
    in the other direction yet, but I do see things leveling off. Part of that
    has been the improvement in technology, for example, Google Docs. The value
    of the electronic form of the document (collaboration) now exceeds the 
    value of the printed form (ease of reading, off-line access). That got me
    to thinking of how much stuff I own, besides the printer, that may eventually
    go away, and it was then that I realized that there's already a bunch of stuff
    that I will never buy again thanks to owning an Android phone:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Watch</li>
      <li>MP3 Player</li>
      <li>GPS</li>
      <li>Compass</li>
      <li>Alarm Clock</li>
      <li>Stopwatch</li>
      <li>Camera</li>
      <li>Calculator</li>
      <li>USB Thumb Drive</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That list will only grow. For example, I soon expect to
      add <a href=http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,66,00.html>Boarding Passes</a>.
    </p>

    <p>And yes, I know, if you are <em>serious</em> about something
    then the smartphone version won't do for you. For serious photography
    people it won't replace their camera. Really into camping and wilderness
    survival, then I doubt you want the smartphone compass. But for most uses
    the smartphone version is good enough, and that means less stuff.
