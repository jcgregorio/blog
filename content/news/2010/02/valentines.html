    Four years ago today I decided I wanted to do something a little
    different for Valentine's Day, so I found some red card stock
    in the house and began cutting out hearts. Lots of hearts. 2 inches
    across, about 50 in total. I then began sticking them up around
    the house, not randomly, but in places where
    Lynne would find them as she went about her daily routine. One on 
    the bathroom mirror, one on the shower door, one on the rear-view
    mirror of the van, etc. She enjoyed it and so did the kids, watching
    her discover each new heart.

    That was four years ago, but the kids were so enthralled with it that
    they've demanded I do it every year since, and I've complied.
    Last year was the toughest year since I was supposed to be traveling on 
    Valentine's Day, which meant that I had to cut out 50 hearts in advance, pre-attach
    sticky gum to the back of each one, and break them into batches for the kids
    to distribute around the house when they got up on Valentine's Day morning.

    This year is no different; it's 2am and I just finished distributing 50 
    hearts around the house. It's no longer surprising for Lynne, and on its fourth
    year is well on its way to becoming a tradition, but I'm going to keep
    on doing it, because our relationship isn't hearts and flowers once a year, but
    all the little things we do each day, every day, together.
