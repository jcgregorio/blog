      The NASA budget request, which actually included a slight budget boost up
      to $19 billion, would cut out the Constellation completely, extend the
      International Space Station's mission through at least 2020, and set
      aside $6 billion over five years to support commercial spacecraft
      development.

      It would also increase funding for fundamental research, Earth science and
      development programs for ground-breaking technology for space exploration.

    There's obviously a lot of hand-wringing about this, which is understandable,
    for many people it's an unthinkable change because NASA has been the
    sole provider of U.S. manned space flight for the past 50 years.
    Personally I'm thrilled.
