    <p>At a previous employer we made tensile testing equipment.
    Now for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_strength>tensile testing</a>
    a material you cut it into a dogbone shape
    and then pull at each end of the dogbone, plotting out the 
    change in length of the specimen against how much load is on
    the specimen. Once you have all that data you can plot
    <a href=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/mechanics-and-strength-of-materials/stress-strain-diagram>stress-strain
      curves and learn all sorts of interesting things about said material</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
    Now if you are developing a new material, or in general working 
    in a laboratory setting, the amount of material to test isn't large,
    and the amount of work of preparing specimens and loading them
    into a tester and reading off the results falls into
    that's-what-we-have-interns-for.
    </p>
    <p>
    If, on the other hand, you are in a manufacturing environment
    and the results of your tensile testing are used as inputs
    into your <a href=http://www.wiptrac.com/WIPtrac/sqcspc.html>SQC/SPC process </a>
    to control your manufacturing line 
    then the amount of testing falls into that's-why-they're-unionized.
    </p>
    <p>
    For those special folks willing to shell out enough money, we offered
    a robotics 'package'. By which, I mean, that our intrepid sales
    folks would offer a robotic automation system to a customer, they
    would feign interest, my boss the engineering manager would 
    pull a ridiculously large number out of thin air in an attempt 
    to dissuade the customer, the sales guy would 'negotiate' with them, and
    the price would drift down low enough that the customer would 
    accept, and the VP of the week for our division would drool, 
    and then we'd be forced into building one. The only problem was
    that we didn't have a robotics package, and so every time we
    got an order we had build up the entire system from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every time the delivery date would slide closer and closer, and 
    Joel, the engineer put in charge of designing these systems, would
    be out on the manufacturing floor assembling a Medusa looking
    nest of wires and robotics, testing and tweaking. We would all help
    out, but invariably as the time got closer we'd joke that he
    should really get it working, because if it wasn't done in time, we
    could always ship them a Joel-in-a-box until we did get it working.
    And we could, you know, because being an engineer, he wasn't unionized.

    This all came rushing back to me the other day when I was reading
    Ian Hickson's draft of the <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75>Web
      Socket protocol</a>. It was written in a very clear and precise manner,
    but also very clearly directed
    at someone that is going to be implementing the protocol, either
    on the client or the server end. It was refreshing to read, and in sharp
    contrast to many of the specifications I've had to read recently. 
    Somewhere between now and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel>Jon Postel</a> 
    we lost something in spec writing. Over time specifications have 
    drifted towards being written in a stiff and officious manner, laden with
    a sense of, but no actual, rigour; as if they were the Doings of Serious Men.
    In the old days RFCs were written more along the lines of "A letter to
    the implementer", with directions on how to implement the protocol. Heck, some
    of them even went so far as to include code. Actual code! The faux rigour
    was something that I fought against, and largely lost, in the writing
    of RFC 5023. Reading the Web Sockets protocol specification did give be that
    flash back to better spec writing. And it also brought back 
    memories of Joel. So here's the rub: Any spec is a good spec 
    if it doesn't require a Joel-in-a-box to get it up and running.
