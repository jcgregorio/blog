    <p>
    So, <a href=http://buzz.google.com/>Buzz</a> is finally out. We've 
    been dogfooding it internally for a while and it's been great.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the best aspects of Buzz is the use of open standards. 
    It's just feeds. And if you want to hook up a new data source
    to Buzz, <a href=http://www.google.com/buzz/bradfitz/PPjHXDhANAC/Want-to-connect-your-blog-or-some-other-feed-to>
      it is just a matter of adding a link/@rel='me'</a>. That two way connection
    between your profile page and the source is the proof that it is a source
    that you truly own. That's a pretty easy thing to do if you
    are a service provider, adding a little markup to allow integration
    with Buzz. And it's not like that information gets locked up; you
    can always pull the site connectivity information back out via the <a href=http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/>Social
      Graph API</a>. Here is <a href="http://socialgraph-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/findyours.html?q=http://www.google.com/profiles/joe.gregorio%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A">
      a demo site for querying the Social Graph API</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>Once you get that working you can always go back and 
    add support for fast updates by pinging a
    <a href=http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/>PubSubHubbub</a> hub. 
    Again, this is a really simple thing to do, and 
    I've done it for <a href=http://code.google.com/p/piccolo-pub/source/browse/hubping>Piccolo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>See <a href=http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API>DeWitt's post</a>
    for where this is all headed and the other open protocols that are going to be integrated.
