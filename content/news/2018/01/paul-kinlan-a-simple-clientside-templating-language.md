Paul Kinlan's [A simple clientside templating langauge](https://paul.kinlan.me/a-simple-dom-template-language/)
has a client side templating library using `data-` attributes, and
the implementation comes in at around 25 lines of code. Definitely a great
example to demystify templating and demonstrate that you don't always need a
framework or large library to get the functionality you want.

[Stamp](https://github.com/jcgregorio/stamp) is a similar library I put
together a few years ago with the same goals in mind, but weights in at 250
lines of code.

I should really update [VanillaJS](https://github.com/jcgregorio/vanillajs)
with a couple more ports, one each for Stamp and Paul's library.
