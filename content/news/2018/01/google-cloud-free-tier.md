Looks like Google Cloud Platform now has a [Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
I know Google App Engine has always had a free tier, it's nice to see Cloud
Platform offer something similar.

That explains why my monthly bill for hosting my blog went from $9/month to
around 0.75$/month. The only thing I exceed the free tier on is egress
bandwidth.
