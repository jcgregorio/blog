Via [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/01/12/birdcage-liners/), I
learned that [Facebook was pivoting away from
engagement](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571).

Meanwhile [Twitter continues to be Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2017/world-leaders-and-twitter.html),
and [Uber](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-11/uber-s-secret-tool-for-keeping-the-cops-in-the-dark) continues to be an ethical cesspool.
