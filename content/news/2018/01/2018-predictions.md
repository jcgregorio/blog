## The End of Crowdsourcing

With Russian bots on Twitter,
[the attack on Rotten Tomatoes scores](https://qz.com/1160551/the-rotten-tomatoes-score-for-the-last-jedi-may-be-rigged/),
[the deluge of fake comments sent to the FCC](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-pew/over-half-of-public-comments-to-fcc-on-net-neutrality-appear-fake-study-idUSKBN1DT297),
[and even attacks on a DARPA Network Challenge](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/how-a-lone-hacker-shredded-the-myth-of-crowdsourcing/), I think 2018
is the beginning of the end for crowdsourcing.

There are two problems to solve, the first is that some of these systems
are trying to extract a signal from noisy data, and it only takes a small
number of bad actors to intentionally inject a strong signal into that data
stream and overwhelm the real signal.

The second problem is simply identity on the web. It's 2018 and it's still
true that [on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog).

I think I'll just keep updating this post with events throughout the year.
