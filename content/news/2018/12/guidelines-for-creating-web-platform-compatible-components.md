Via [Alex Russell](https://infrequently.org/2018/12/alice-boxhall-for-w3c-tag/), I just found
[Guidelines for creating web platform compatible components](https://w3ctag.github.io/webcomponents-design-guidelines/),
which further contains a link to [The Gold Standard Checklist for Web Components](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki),
both of which look like excellent resources when creating custom elements.

This is a good time to mention that work is progressing on

[neat](https://bitworking.org/news/2018/02/custom-elements-neat) Vanilla JS
custom elements.
