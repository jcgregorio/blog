    <p>
    Negative externalities are the bane of a market economy. Those wider costs to
    products and services that aren’t included in the actual cost of a item can
    wreak major havoc on society and almost always result in years of litigation,
    lawmaking, and acrimony between businesses and government. So what exactly is
    an negative externality? Let’s start with the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality>definition of externality from
      Wikipedia</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote><p>
      In economics, an externality (or transaction spillover) is a cost or benefit,
      not transmitted through prices[1], incurred by a party who did not agree to the
      action causing the cost or benefit. A benefit in this case is called a positive
      externality or external benefit, while a cost is called a negative externality
      or external cost.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The examples of negative externalities are legion: smoking causing cancer,
    asbestos causing cancer, CO2 causing global warming, lead in gas or paint
    leading to lead poisoning, ozone depleting CFCs, acid rain inducing sulfur
    emissions, etc. In each of the cases the discovery of the negative externality
    was followed by years of costly litigation, acrimony, industry FUD,
    astroturfing, lobbying, lawmaking, and more litigation. In each of the cases
    there was an industry supplying a product that produced the products with the
    negative externalities that fought the imposition of legislation governing the
    externality with all their might, including litigation, lobbying, and
    astroturfing. In all cases the goal was not to protect their customers, or that
    they really believed that the negative externalities didn’t exist, but to
    protect their business from taxation, or litigation by those affected by the
    negative externality. Cigarette companies knew that smoking caused cancer and
    did their level best to hide that finding, or to discredit those that brought
    the information forward. Their attack on the science around smoking and cancer
    was about protecting their business, not about protecting their customers from
    cancer. There’s an obvious cost, both economic and societal, when the
    incentives are for a company to hide, deny, attack, or otherwise ignore
    negative externalities of their products. Wouldn’t it be nice to reverse the
    direction of that incentive? 
    </p>

    <p>To reverse the incentive what we need is way to change the playing field so
    that it is in companies best interest to publicly acknowledge negative
    externalities, and the best way I can think to do that is a 
    <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor>Safe Harbor</a> law.
    </p>

    <blockquote><p>
      A safe harbor is a provision of a statute or a regulation that reduces or
      eliminates a party's liability under the law, on the condition that the party
      performed its actions in good faith. Legislators include safe-harbor provisions
      to protect legitimate or excusable violations. An example of safe harbor is
      performance of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment by a property purchaser:
      thus effecting due diligence and a "safe harbor" outcome if future
      contamination is found caused by a prior owner.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> For example, the DMCA contains a safe harbor provision for Internet Service
    Providers; as long as they respond to take-down notices in a timely manner
    according to the law then they can not be held liable for their user’s actions.
    A similar law should be put in place for negative externalities for products.
    As long as a company publicly acknowledges the negative externality then they
    can not be held liable for the negative effect. In the case of smoking, once a
    tobacco company acknowledged that smoking caused cancer then they could not be
    held liable by their customers for the cancer causing effects of smoking. 
    </p>

    <p> Such a law would completely change the dynamics of companies in an industry
    that had discovered a negative externality. Think of it from a game theory
    perspective, where each of the companies involved faces a prisoner’s dilemma
    for disclosing the negative externality. Without a safe harbor provision the
    cost of defection (acknowledgement) is very high, while the cost of cooperation
    (keeping the negative externality a secret) is low. With the safe harbor law in
    place, the benefit of defection would swamp the cost of cooperation. It would
    be in a companies best interest financially to find and expose negative effects
    as soon as possible, to make sure they would qualify for the safe harbor
    provision.
    </p>

    <p> Now this is easier said than done, as the law would have to carefully crafted.
    For example, what class of products does this apply to? What does it mean to
    “acknowledge” a negative externality? How long can a company wait after their
    competitors have acknowledged a negative externality to also acknowledge it and
    still gain the benefits of the liability shield. Even with such a law in place
    the corporations involved would still lobby for their industry, as the tobacco
    lobby now does against the FDA regulating nicotine, and the coal and oil
    industries lobby against the EPA regulating CO2 emissions. Still, it is usually
    years if not decades between the discovery of a negative externality and the
    time legislation begins in earnest, and a safe harbor law could slash that time
    to a fraction of that, and in the process save the economy a lot of wasted
    money.
