Dear Sir or Madam,

this is a default template that gets sent out automatically in the licensed version.
This is written in English and will be send out to all people if not some other template might match (e.g. the *@*.de one).

As you may see here, you can use different tags like word2 to generate a different email each time.

You can also use the following things here:

  joe@bitworking.org - gets replaced with the email of the person you are emailing to
  http://wellformedweb.org/story/9 - the url where this email was found
  wellformedweb.org - the domain of the url where the email was found
  N/A - if extra data was collected it will be inserted here


With best Regards
Email Spider
