Over the years I have run many projects, everything from small software projects
of just a couple people, to new product development projects in the material
testing space, include both hardware and software, to large projects involving
work that effects the daily routines of thousands of software engineers. In that
time I've honed down how I think about project management into just two axioms,
which, if you know the field of project management is quite short.

If you were to search across the web today you'd find a slew of randomly
enumerated fundamentals of project management, including, but certainly not
limited to:

- 5 C's of project management
- 5 P's of project management
- The 5 principles of project management
- The 12 principles of project management
- 50+ Axioms on the Art and Science of Managing Projects

Being a trained mathematician I can tell you for certain that if you've got 50+
axioms, you clearly don't know the meaning of "axiom".

Anyway, for you dear reader, I am going to break down project management into
just two axioms.

The first axiom of project planning:

> Starting is definite, finishing less so.

So what does that mean? Well maybe let's start with a more colloquial saying,
which is:

> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

See how we know when the journey begins, when we take that first step, and we
can definitely say when we are going to start. But when, exactly, will we finish
that journey of 1,000 miles? Presuming we're going to walk, that's going to take
quite a while and the exact finish date of our journey is going to be highly
variable. Like highly higly variable. Consider hiking the Appalachian Trail:

> Completing the entire 2,190+ miles of the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) in one trip
> is a mammoth undertaking. Each year, thousands of hikers attempt a thru-hike;
> only about one in four makes it all the way.
>
> A typical thru-hiker takes 5 to 7 months to hike the entire A.T.

--[The Appalachian Trail
Conservancy](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/)

So in the case of hiking the Appalachian Trail, the task duration, on average,
is infinity. Infinity! If only 1/4 of the hikers actually finish hiking the
trail in any year, the remaining 3/4 don't finish it, the average time to finish
the project is ∞. I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that [5
months, ∞\) is a huge amount of uncertainty.

Just the [list of failed and overbudget custom software
projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects#Projects_with_ongoing_problems)
is worth an entire Wikipedia entry.

And there are projects that have gone on so long that they've become legendary,
like [Duke Nukem Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever)
which took 14 years to ship.

The longer a task takes, the higher the uncertainty of when it will finish.

Think of a simple task, like vacuuming the house. This has a short time, and you
can probably predict with pretty good accuracy how long it will take you to
complete the task. And yes, leave it to your kids and it might never get done, but
let's not go there.

Compare that to taking on a larger project, like building a skyscraper, a
sub-division, or something never accomplished before, like a fusion reactor, and
the uncertainty rises dramatically.

But what to we do in the face of such uncertainty?

The second axiom of project planning:

> Divide and conquer to reduce uncertainty

Yeah, really, it's that simple. If you have a large, complex, or ambiguous task,
then break it down into smaller more manageable tasks. And this division can be
across any number of divisions, such as time or resources. For example we could
divide up our Appalachian Trail hiking into first figuring out how many days of
food and water we can carry, along with preliminary test hikes to see how many
miles a day we can cover on similar terrain.

And this loops back around to our first axoim, the shorter the sub-tasks we can
break down our project into the less ambiguity we'll have at every step, because
the shorter the step, the lower the uncertainty.

So now we have our two axioms:

## The Axioms of Project Management:

1. Starting is definite, finishing less so.
2. Divide and conquer to reduce uncertainty.

In my next installment I'll talk about how to apply these axioms to a project to
reduce uncertainty, and how everything you've learned about project management
is probably wrong.
