  <p><a href="http://make.oreilly.com/">Make</a>, a new mook (hybrid magazine/book) 
   from O'Reilly, and edited by <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1922">
  Mark Frauenfelder</a>.</p>
<p><blockquote>Make brings the do-it-yourself mindset to all the technology in your life. 
   Make is loaded with exciting projects that help you make the most of your technology 
   at home and away from home. This is a magazine that celebrates your right to tweak, 
   hack, and bend any technology to your own will.</blockquote></p>
<p>Looks like a very cool publication. In addition, on the link blog for Make,
   I found a link to <a href="http://www.howtoons.org/">howtoons</a>.</p>
<p><blockquote>Howtoons are one-page cartoons showing 5-to-15 year-old kids "How To" build
  things. Each illustrated episode is a stand-alone fun adventure accessible to all, 
  including the pre-literate. Our Howtoons are designed to encourage children to be 
  active participants in discovering the world through Play-that-Matters -- fun, creative, 
  and inventive -- and to rely a lot less on mass-consumable entertainment.</blockquote></p>
<p>I don't know what to build first, the Shockwave Air Cannon, or the Marshmallow Shooter.</p>
