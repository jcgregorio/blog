title: For some definition of REST

  <p>Bloglines has <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/pr_09282004">announced new 
   web services</a> that they offer. Unfortunately, they tried to attach themselves 
   to the term <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">REST</a> without 
   really understanding it. I am encouraged that
   the term, and the idea of alternatives to SOAP, are gaining traction, but
   not at the expense of corrupting the meaning.</p>
<p>So what is the problem? The <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/getitems">
   getitems</a> operation works via GET even
   though it will "mark unread items as read". This is clearly not an 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2">idempotent</a> 
   operation. It would have been better to opt for POST and not GET. 
   It's a <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/api">common problem</a>.
