  <p>Things are rather slow these days, or at least I'm feeling particularly lazy. Either way, here's a bunch of little things I've found interesting over the past week or so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/duh/">DUH</a>, or Dilbert's Ultimate House, via <a href="http://w-uh.com/posts/041129a.html">Ole</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timhunkin.com/94_illegal_engineering.htm">Safes and Safe-Cracking</a> via <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/12/safes_and_safec.html">Bruce Schneier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> is now in Beta. To test it out I remembered 
<a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/18/HowSearchWorks">Tim Bray, in his series on search</a>, 
 had mentioned that Gerald Salton had written most of the basic reference works on text search. So I gave
 Scholar a spin with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Gerald+Salton&amp;btnG=Search">Gerald Salton</a>.
</p>
<p>I am planning on doing some performance tests on caching in HTTP and was thinking of ways I could accomplish that. I really wanted a separate machine for the cache, yet didn't want to tinker with the Debian backup server for obvious reasons.  It looks like I can setup Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_cache.html">mod_cache</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a> on a machine on my network at home, then it will be easy to configure my Python test scripts to use that proxy server. Since Apache runs under Windows I can just put my proxy server on one of the kids computers.</p>
<p>Good introductory article on the Economist about <a href="http://economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=3422965">Green Architecture</a>. It's also nice that they provide links for further reading outside their own domain. I still occasionally run into online newspapers that provide no links to anything outside themselves. </p>
<p>Lately, for inspiration, I've been browsing the <a href="http://lxr.linux.n">Linux source code</a>.</p>
<p>Analog Devices has released a development board targeting <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/epHSProd/0,,BF533-STAMP,00.html">uClinux on the Blackfin</a>.</p>
