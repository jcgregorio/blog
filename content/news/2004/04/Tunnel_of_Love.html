  <p>First we had HTTP.</p>
<p>Then we had SOAP, which tunneled RPC over HTTP.</p>
<p>And now to complete the circle we have 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-soap12-rep-20040428/">
   SOAP Resource Representation Header</a>, which lets you
   tunnel HTTP over SOAP.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>

    Sam,<br />
  When I saw that I just slapped my forehead. What was I thinking? A single 'meta' element is of course completely equvalent to tunneling the entire contents and headers of an HTTP based resource over SOAP. I hang my head in shame for not recognizing it earlier. Good thing you were here to point it out.

    <p>Yeah, I know, just what we need, one more entry in our ever widening variety of standards.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I think I get what they're talking about, but I also think this might raise the eyebrow of a security officer or three. Am I wrong to assume this?</p>
