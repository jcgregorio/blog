  <p>What you do with a RISC chip with gobs of MIPS? 
   Well you port Linux to it, what else?
   LinuxDevices.com is 
   <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9596714596.html">reporting that
   uClinux has been ported</a> to the Blackfin by <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/MW/Develop/Embedded/Linux/BSPs/blackfin.htm">
   Metrowerks</a>. Their port
   is based on the 2.4.6 kernel and contains support for many of the peripherals
   including the high-speed synchronous serial ports (SPORT).
</p>
<p>This is the first port of uClinux to a DSP but not the last, only recently
   <a href="http://www.softier.com/">Softier</a> announced that they
   had completed a <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3468265897.html">
   port of uClinux to the Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320DM64x line of DSPs</a>.
