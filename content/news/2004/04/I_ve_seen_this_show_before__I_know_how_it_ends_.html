  RealPlayer sucks</a>. 
Not the actual technology, which for a long time had a complete lock on 
audio and video streaming over the internet, and of which I used to be 
a happy consumer, but two things happened to erode Reals dominance. 
The first is that Microsoft saw a market that they didn't have 
99% market share in and decided to start leveraging their monopoly 
on the desktop to try to squeeze out Real. This alone is fascinating 
since yet again MS is going after a market where the client is given 
away for free, just like they did with the browser market. 
My prediction is that in the end they will succeed in displacing Real, 
replacing RealPlayer with at best a mediocre client, then once the 
battle is won they will realize they have a monopoly that 
is useless. They will have a monopoly on audio/video players 
that is completely unleveragable, just like the browser. Congratulations,
you have a 90% market share in web browsers, care to explain
how you're going to monetize that? After realizing that they'll
abandon all new development and leave customers in the 
lurch with a poor, unmaintained client and no competition.</p>
<p>But that's not what I wanted to talk about, 
  what I really wanted to focus on is the 
  <b>other</b> reason that Real will go out of business.</p>

  
<p>The idea behind RealPlayer is to give away the client for free 
in the hope of selling server software for serving up the content. 
Note that this is the same model that Netscape had.

Somewhere along the way Real looked at all those downloads of the
free player and got greedy, first by offering a "Premium" 
player for pay, then by going to what will certainly go 
down in history as the most agressive obfuscation and 
upsell campaign in history. The process to 
download and install the free RealPlayer is now an 
exercise in stealth (see if you can actually find 
the free version to download) and tedium (now unckeck 
all these boxes to avoid being spammed, don't forget 
to scroll down the page). Then, and only then, if you 
actually get past the install, manage to avoid getting 15 links splattered across your desktop, start menu and who knows 
where else, then you get <em>...drumroll...</em> a whole new source of pop-ups! Everytime you start the program it, 
by default, drops onto a page that is basically an 
advertisement for Real, and then again when you quit 
it pops up an ad. All of this is annoying, 
annoying, annoying, and I'm not the only one to feel
that way, turns out 
<a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/real/">
the folks at CarTalk got so many complaints that they dropped RealPlayer</a>.</p>
<p>Real will go out of business or at the very least 
be driven to be a marginal player with a meager market share. 
They'll point to Microsoft as the source of all their woes when 
in fact it was their own greed and shortsightedness that will put 
them under. I've seen this show before, I know how it ends. </p>

    <p>It took me quite a bit of looking, but I eventually found some codecs for realplayer.  Media Player Classic is now perfectly happy playing .ra and .ram streams.</p>
<p>No popups, no adds, no spam, no ugly ui.</p>

    <p>There's a good series of articles on this starting at: <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/02/29/real_obnoxious">http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/02/29/real_obnoxious</a>.  He apparently got to talk to some former Real Networks employees who dished the dirt.  Wired also did a story recently<br />

<p>It's true, MS is a formidable enough competitor that you don't need to help them.  Real's CEO is a former MS employee, you'd think he'd know that.</p>

    <p>MS can make money the same way Real does - on the server side. Hardly useless having a monopoly on the client side; everyone has to buy your server software (until the EU steps in...)</p>
<p>The link you posted to CarTalk shows that they have changed their minds and are now using Real again.</p>
<p>I hate Real, but I found the free version quite easy to download. It's not nearly as invasive as it was in the past (still not perfect though).</p>
<p>I hate WMP too, so I'm not in a happy place;)</p>

    <p>Microsoft will monetize their player strategy the same way Apple is monetizing iTunes. Microsoft will be entering the portable player and download-for-a-fee market, and media player dominance is a cornerstone peice to making that strategy work. Apple has shown the way for easy-to-use, vertically integrated music distribution. Indeed, their strategy to create the tools that artists and recording studios use, all the way to the player that people use to listen to that music points to a level of influence (control is too strong a word) that I'm sure Microsoft is quite envious of.</p>
<p>Will they start charging for Media Player directly? No. They're giving away the razor so they can sell the blades.</p>
<p>As for Real, I agree that their offensive tactics will drive people away from their player without any help from Microsoft. I'd be interested to see if there has been a study to determine if the annoyanceware strategy has a net positive value. Irritating potential customers seems like a bad idea to me, but then again, people buy stuff from spammers, so applying rational thought to this problem may be inappropriate.</p>

    The only reason companies choose Real or Windows Media formats is because of DRM (digital rights management). The problem is that the creators of free standards for audio such as Ogg Vorbis probably oppose the closed nature of DRM-protected streams as much as they oppose the technology itself being closed-source or patented.

    <p>It's true, the spam that RealPlayer incorporates into their player makes it a useless piece of crap.  Windows Media Player has come a long way since the drab gray colored CD player.  But, I've always been a huge fan of WinAmp.  Their software beats the rest hands down.  They do offer a PRO version of their software, but it just adds the functionality of Nero or any other CD burning/ripping utility.</p>
<p>Why does WinAmp beat the competition?  Here's some reasons:<br />
no popup ads<br />
fast &amp; easy installation<br />
some of the best skins I've ever seen<br />
extremely easy to use Internet Radio and TV in their media library<br />
customizable to your hearts content</p>
<p>I'll continue to use it as long as it's around provided they don't mimic RealPlayer's obnoxiousness.</p>
