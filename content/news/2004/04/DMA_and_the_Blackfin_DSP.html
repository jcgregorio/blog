  <p>Every day there's more to like about the <a href="http://www.analog.com/processors/processors/blackfin/">Analog Devices
  Blackfin DSP</a>. Today the big wins are DMA transfers 
  and built in libraries.</p>

<dt>DMA</dt>

<p>So what is DMA? If you aren't familiar with DMA, it's the ability
        of the processor to transfer memory to or from other memory locations
        or peripherals without the attention of the CPU. 
        This means that 
        there is a separate DMA engine sitting inside the chip acting like
        a gremlim, moving things about while no one is looking. And gremlin
        is an appropriate image since DMA in the past had a bit of a reputation
        for being complex, error prone, and unreliable at least among 
        the embedded developers I know. The upside of DMA is that it can free 
        the processor from huge amounts of work it would normally have to
        do itself. </p>
<p>For example, many chips have UARTS for serial communication that
        can be accessed via DMA. If you had a long string of data to read
        in from the port there are only three choices: poll, interrupts, or
        DMA. In polling you periodically check on the UARTS buffer and copy out
        any values that have arrived since the last time you checked. This requires
        you to check back often and to be careful lest you not check back
        quickly enough and the buffer overflows and you lose data. 
        With interrupts you write an interrupt
        handler that gets called every time N new values have arrived in the buffer.
        Interrupts guarantee that you get there in time but they still take processing
        time away from your main process, and let's not even delve in what happens
        when higher priority interrupts are occuring rapidly at the same time.
        With DMA you set the DMA engine off and running and at the end you 
        can probably setup an interrupt to be triggered once the whole
        buffer has arrived, meanwhile you have 100% of the processor time to 
        allocate to your main process. Now compound this with the fact that 
        many DMAs can run multiple different kinds of transfers at the same time
        and you can see how powerful they become.
     </p>
<p>On a PC the only time
        you would encounter DMA is if you were doing device driver development.
        In the embedded world you encounter them much more often because 
        your programming much closer to the metal and more often than not
        working in a constrained environment where you need to squeeze the 
        most performance from your chip.
     </p>
<p>With anything as powerful as DMA there are issues, the first being
        that they are complex to setup. This is something the designers of the
        TI DSPs seemed to revel in. The setup of a DMA transfer requires setting
        up two 32-bit control registers where each bit affects the transfer in 
        some way or another. On top of that there are a dozen or so other
        registers that may be used, depending, of course, on the setup of those
        64 bits in the control registers. But even here, they just couldn't stop 
        themselves because they must have decided their DMA engine was getting too
        large, so what did they do? Reduce the number of options? No. Simplify? No. What
        they did is decide that having all those other registers was the problem,
        so different DMA transfers would share those registers. Share them. And of course
        since they're sharing you have to use <strong>more</strong> control 
        bits to the control registers to
        select <em>which</em> of the shared registers you are using.
     </p>
<p>Compare this to the Analog Devices Blackfin DMA controller. There is a single
        16-bit DMA control register and each transfer has a unique set of other
        registers. No sharing. How did they do this? By concentrating on making the easy things
        easy and the hard things possible. You see, the basic DMA covers most of 
        my needs and is configured easily. If a more complex DMA transfer is needed
        they actually used a clever technique where you setup structures in memory with control
        information and chain them together, a linked list of structures,
        then you feed the first structure to
        the DMA engine and off it goes following the instructions at each
        structure then automatically jumping to the next one. It's a great setup
        and makes it even more flexible than the TI DSP's DMA with its 64-bits of 
        configuration.</p>
<p>The usual caveat should be applied here that I am only
        talking about a single family of the TI DSP and I don't have experience 
        with other families which may have different schemes.</p>

<dt>Libraries</dt>
<dd>
<p>Now if DMAs aren't your thing how about FFTs? Well if you're using a DSP you'd be 
       quite likely to want to do such things. TI handled this by having a 
       large download section with plug in modules that dropped into 
       the development environment to cover basic signal processing algorithms.
       They have constructed a whole mechanism where a provider can write a library
       and have it work across a range of their DSP families. 
    </p>
<p>This is how I expected Analog Devices works with their DSPs so I 
       go on line and try to download the required modules from their site, but for the
       life of me I can't find any place to download the modules. I searched and 
       searched and in a last act of desperation I typed 'FFT' into the 
       developement tools help system. Now, that last statement could be read
       as, "in a last act of desperation I read the manual", but we won't go there.
       As it turns out I didn't <em>need</em> to go to their site, nor did I need 
       to use any special module loading, the Blackfin developement tools ships with 
       DSP library that includes real FFTs, complex FFTs, fir filters, auto-correlation,
       etc., etc. Built in. To the default library. For a DSP. A Digital Signal Processor. 
       In retrospect it just seems so obvious.

<p>At this point I'm still learning about this chip and it's capabilities,
   I may yet run across something I don't like, 
   but so far I'm impressed both with the robustness of the product and the
   obvious thought that went into it's design.</p>
