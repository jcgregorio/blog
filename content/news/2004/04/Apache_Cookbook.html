  <p>One of the books that hasn't left my
    desk in the last month has been

    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001916/bitworking-20">
        Apache Cookbook.</a>
    Betweeen setting up web services at work, tweaking
    with the tools that support this site, plus
    the implementations I have been experimenting
    with in Atom, it has been in constant sight.
    The nice part about Apache Cookbook, like all
    of the books in the O'Reilly Cookbook series, is that
    the content is task oriented.</p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001916/bitworking-20">
<img class="unframed" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0596001916.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Apache Cookbook" title="Apache Cookbook" />
</a>
<p>The content ranges over a wide set of topics and covers
    basic as well as more advanced topics. For example, there
    are recipes for "Installing Apache on Windows", "Tuning Thread
    Creation", and "Preventing Your Proxy Server from Being Used as an Open
    Mail Relay."</p>
<p>One aspect I appreciate with Apache Cookbook is the
    candor. For example, the Solution in Chapter 6.2 "Setting Up Single-Use Passwords"
    is "No solution is avialable with standard Apache features". I appreciate
    the inclusion of a recipe that has no solution, it provides
    useful information for what obviously is a frequently
    asked question.
</p>
<p>I am apparently not the only one that likes it as it is <a href="http://ken.coar.org/burrow/index.html?entry=908&amp;comments=true">apparently
   approaching a second printing</a>.</p>
