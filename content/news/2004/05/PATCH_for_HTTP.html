title: PATCH for HTTP
date: 2004-05-18T12:00:00-04:00

  <p>An interesting new draft was just published by Lisa Dusseault of 
  the <a href="http://osafoundation.org">OSAF</a>. <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dusseault-http-patch-02.txt">   Partial Document Changes (PATCH Method) for HTTP</a>.
  Discussion is being carried out on <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/">ietf-http-wg@w3.org</a>.
  My one nit with the RFC is that it fails to mention where the discussion is taking place.   
  More thoughts later as I dig in further.
