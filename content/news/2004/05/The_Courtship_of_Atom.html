  <p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/19/deviant.html">Kendall</a> weighs 
   in with his reasons why Atom should choose to join the W3C. I haven't been
   listing everyones opinions as I come across them. If you are interested 
   most people have weighed in the <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/index.html">atom-syntax</a> mailing list.

   Kendall's arguments
   are a mixed bag in that many on them apply to just joining any 
   standards body, and he also mentions
   advantages that can only be found in the W3C.  As of this point
   I'm still very much on the fence as to which I prefer. I believe
   that no matter which standards body the Atom community 
   chooses that we'll do fine. We've got a strong community
   around Atom that at times is contentious and quirky, but we've
   survived quite well 'in the wild' so far and the structure
   of a standards body will only help. Atom can survive the 
   W3C, but can the W3C survive Atom? &lt;wink/&gt;

    I think the Atom "WG" that exists is so well structured that it won't matter much where Atom gets standardized. I've always had an emotional attraction towards W3C, so that's where my vote goes. If we don't go with W3C, IETF will be just fine as well. I'm not that pattionate or fanatic about it, I just want the darn thing standardized one way or another. ;-)
