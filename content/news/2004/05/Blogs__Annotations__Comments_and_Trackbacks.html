  <p>James Tauber notes some <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2004/04/29/blogs_annotations_comments_and_trackbacks">
   similarities between annotations, comments and trackbacks</a>. This
   is the same similarity I noticed a while ago and was the 
   impetus for the creation of the <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">CommentAPI</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The same functionality as the CommentAPI is also available under Atom <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/CommentsAreEntries">since 
   comments are treated the same as entries</a>. 
   The equivalent of the CommentAPI under the AtomAPI is a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/LinkTagMeaning">
   PostURI on the entry</a>. That <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-gregorio-09.html#Post">PostURI</a>
   on the entry can be found either by a link tag in the 
   feed or via a link tag in the HTML header of the entry.
   Now matter how you find it, posting an entry to such a 
   PostURI will create a comment/annotation/trackback for that entry.
