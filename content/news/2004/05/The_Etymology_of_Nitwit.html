title: The Etymology of Nitwit

  <p>I love the term nitwit. I love what it means and 
   I love how it sounds. From <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nitwit">dictionary.com</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>nitwit</dt>
<dd>A stupid or silly person.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I grew up believing that nitwit was 
   closely related to nitpicking, that both
   terms were about nits.  </p>
<dl>
<dt>nit</dt>
<dd>The egg or young of a parasitic insect, such as a louse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is, I thought the term nitpicking came from
   picking nits, which, louse being very small
   and their eggs being even smaller, well, you get
   the idea. Now I was suprised to find the etymology of nitwit on 
   dictionary.com makes no reference to nits as in louse eggs
   but instead attributes it to the German word for nothin, <dfn>nit</dfn> or <dfn>niht</dfn>.
   The story is the same for nitpicking, which is apprently about 
   picking 'nothing'. I find that less than satisfactory
   and wonder if there is some connection between the German word
   for nothing and louse eggs.

    "Nit" is used in certain local German dialects; it's "nicht", not "niht"; and the German word for louse egg is "Nisse" ;-)
