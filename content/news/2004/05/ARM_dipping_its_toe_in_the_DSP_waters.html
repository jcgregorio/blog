  <p>It would appear that <a href="http://www.eet.com/semi/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=20300929">
   ARM is dipping its toe in the DSP waters</a>, at least that is how
   EETimes is spinning it, but <a href="http://www.arm.com/miscPDFs/analyst04.zip">
   looking at the companies presenatations</a>
  [pdf!] it looks more like they are trying to compete
   with DSPs. Their strategy is to offer "Data Engines" which 
   are flexible parts of the architecture that are tuned at compile
   time to the algorithms being executed. If this sounds hauntingly
   familiar it's because this is the same strategy that 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Weighing_your_choices_among_DSP_vs_FPGA_vs_ASIC">
   Stretch</a> recently announced with their S5000 processors. I panned that
   processor pretty hard and I feel the same about ARM. Why? The problem
   comes down to a very basic understanding of the market, that is, the
   only people that this processor feature will appeal to will be 
   those developers that don't alread know the bottlenecks in their
   system and honestly if you don't know that already then you've got
   bigger problems than just choosing a DSP or an FPGA.
