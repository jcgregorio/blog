  <p>While everyone is looking at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-delany-domainkeys-base-00.txt">DomainKeys</a>
  as a method of controlling spam, I think the implications are 
  much broader. I first saw that DomainKeys could be harnessed 
  to stop comment span on blogs, then my thinking got even wider; here is a piece of 
  infrastructure for enabling 'identity' on the web using public
  key encryption and tied to the indentity platform that is DNS. Now 
  some may cry foul that DNS is evil because it is a centralized service,
  but the important point is that it is a centralized service with
  a system already in place for distributed authorized updates. 
  How soon until having your own domain name with a
  public key stored ala DomainKeys is a critical part of your online
  life? </p>

   The myth of interference</a>. Information and electromagnetic radio waves are 
   not <em>physical objects</em> and can have some pretty counter-intuitive properties.

<p>I wonder how many millions of dollars of research time Bruce Sterling
   has just sucked out of Microsoft <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=319591">
  all for the sake of having 
  a better party next year?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/05/task-office">Kottke</a> mentions Jane Jacobs'
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067974195X/bitworking-20">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a> as an inspiration for organizing offices. I'll write more
later about <b>altering</b> books, books that I've read that have 
changed the way I see and think about the world. Jacob's book is one
of those.</p>

    Re "the myth of intereference": don't read too much into Salon's rendition of what Reed is saying. Popular as it may sound, capacity <b>is</b> limited once you realize that global aggregated networks require each and every node to "play along" to actually work. See, for example, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2002/12/14.html">http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2002/12/14.html</a>.
