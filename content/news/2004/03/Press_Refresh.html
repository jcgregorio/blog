  <p>It's that time of year again, with spring in the air I've refreshed the style of BitWorking. Press 'refresh' if you see the same old styling. If you have a decent browser you can switch back to the old look as I've left it as an alternate stylesheet.</p>
<p>Putting together a new style was easier than in previous attempts. Two things in particular made it easier, the first was using 
the <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#webdeveloper">Web Developer</a> extensions for Mozilla FireFox, a nifty tool that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adds a menu and a toolbar to the browser with various web developer tools. Current tools include converting form POSTs to GETs, hiding images, outlining block level elements, disabling styles and many more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second thing that made development easier was the new rule of thumb I learned for working with CSS; only set non-zero padding or margins on element, not both. That simple rule is meant to avoid trouble with IE's botched box-model. It worked, and there were only two minor hiccups when I finally checked the site in IE.</p>
<p>I have currently checked this site with IE 6, FireFox and Opera 7 under Windows only. Let me know if you have any problems with the new layout.</p>

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    <p>Very nice!<br />
Looks good on IE6, Firefox and Lynx here. </p>
<p>One minor point - on 1400x1050 (Inspiron)Â  the content only uses about half of the screen. If there was a way to float everything to the centre (without breaking anything else) it would be slightly prettier.</p>

    <p>Looks great in Konqueror 3.2 and Opera 7.23 for Linux.</p>
<p>In IE 5 and IE 5.5, it also looks mostly as intended, but the Google ads overlap most of the articles, making it hard to read the articles.</p>
