title: Character Encoding is Hard

  <p>Character encoding is hard. Really. If I could point to
one thing that causes feeds to be invalid more than anything
else, it would be character encoding. When I first started 
working with RSS I was always suprised at the energy 
Bill Kearney put into character encoding. If there was one thing you
could count on, it was Bill would always jump into a conversation
on character encoding. Two years later and I am finally coming 
to that place. That place where I jump into any discussion
on character encoding. I finally get it, and I finally see what
grief is causes with XML, and not just in RSS feeds, but in other
areas too. Don't believe me? <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=9L6dnSQDVMjVjtLdRVn-jA%40speakeasy.net">Not even DMOZ can get character encoding
right</a> [via <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/blinks/2004/03/#b3455">diveintomark</a>].</p><p>
</p><p>You see, this is one of the things about XML, a conformant XML processor
is only <strong>required</strong> to accept "utf-8" and "utf-16".  
So it's possible that an XML processor could reject "Shift_JIS", or "ISO-2022-JP".
Who knows, there might even be an XML processor
out there that rejects well-formed XML encoded in "utf-32".
The more I learn about character encoding the more I like "utf-8".

    Amen to that, Joe. I deal with character encoding daily with my work on ecto: <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000818.php">http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000818.php</a>
