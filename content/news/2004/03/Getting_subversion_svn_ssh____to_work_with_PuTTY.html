title: Getting subversion svn+ssh// to work with PuTTY
date: 2004-03-12T12:00:00-05:00
---

  <p>Now I initially tried doing all this with PuTTY and pageant, and any tips 
  on how to get it working would be appreciated.</p>

  
<p>I wanted to use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> and host the repository 
  on my hosted site, but running the dedicated server, or
  the running it thought WebDAV are basically out of the 
  question. The dedicated server isn't allowed by policy
  and while Michal, the owner of <a href="http://cornerhost.com">cornerhost</a>
  is a great guy and probably would have worked with me to get 
  the WebDAV server up and running, I didn't want to tie up his and my 
  time setting it up. I had seen people with root on their own machine
  spend quite a bit of time setting up subversion and WebDAV.</p>
<p>Now this didn't leave me out in the cold, I can still try, try being
 the optional word, using the svn+ssh:// option. This requires no long 
  running services or extra  ports, it just tunnels svn over ssh, which 
  fits in the guidelines of my hosting provider. Now since I already
  have PuTTY setup on my client I should just be able to edit the local
  subversion <code>config</code> config file and tell it to use
  plink instead of ssh:
</p>
<pre><code>[tunnels]
ssh=plink
</code></pre>
<p>But lo, it was not to be. I kept getting <code>svn: Connection closed unexpectedly</code>. A little bit of debugging and I found the problem. Subversion 
starts plink/ssh and has it start with the command 'svnserve -t'. When plink or ssh is given a command to execute, the sshd server doesn't start a shell, instead it tries to run the command directly. But, without running the shell, my PATH on my server won't be setup
correctly, and since I have installed subversion locally, the executable isn't found and the plink/ssh fails.</p>
<p>Now I thought I had a solution when I read about sshd's support for the 
<code>~/.ssh/environment</code> file. This is a file that is filled with 
environment variables to be set for any running command. But lo, it was not to be
either, the default setting for sshd are to not process that file.</p>
<p>Finally, I discovered that ssh <strong>does</strong> allow you to add in <em>options</em>
for each key in <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, and one of those options is a program to run no matter what, over-riding whatever is sent by the client as a program to run. So I had my solution, create a new key, and have that new key always run 'svnserve -t'. Which is exactly
what I did, adding the following line to my ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:</p>
<pre><code>command="/home/myusername/bin/svnserve -t" ssh-dss AAAA.......</code></pre>
<p>Now when I connected in from the client with pageant only loaded with my <em>new</em>
  key everything worked:</p>
<p>svn list svn+ssh://myusername@bitworking.org/home/myusername/archives/test</p>
<p>Note the caveat, with only the new key loaded. Once I load up both my keys into pageant
the old breakage comes back. That's because pageant tries every key in turn, and ended up picking the old one first. Setting up a Saved Session, and specifying the "Private key for authentication" didn't work either, I believe that's because the availability of pageant
keys trumps this setting, but of that I am not sure.</p>
<p>In the end the solution was to break up the responsibilities, I use PuTTY for all my interactive shells, and for subversion I use the 'ssh' that comes with cygwin. This has the added benefit of not requiring any tweaking of the subversion config file. Still, I would
like to know if I missed anything in my setup of PuTTY that would have allowed me to use
it for both terminal sessions and for subversion. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>On the client from which you will be ssh'ing:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -f mykey
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in mykey.
Your public key has been saved in mykey.pub.
</code></pre>
<p>Move <code>mykey</code> to <code>~/.ssh/id_dsa</code> for the client.</p>
<p>Copy mykey.pub onto the server that is hosting
   subversion. Append the value of <code>mykey.pub</code>
   to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Be sure
   to pre-pend the line with a command="" statement that
   calls up svn:
</p>
<pre><code>
command="/home/jcgregorio/bin/svnserve -t" ssh-dss AAA...
</code></pre>
<p>To test your configuration, ssh into the server from the client. You should see:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh username@servername.org
( success ( 1 2 ( ANONYMOUS EXTERNAL ) ( edit-pipeline ) ) )
Connection to servername.org closed.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an updated method from <a href="http://diveintmark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a>:</p>
<p>The problem we're tying to solve here is that if you configure ssh as we have done
   above then everytime you ssh into that server you end up in subversion. That's not  
   very helpful if you want to get to a bash shell. </p>
<p>The solution starts with creating a sub-domain for the host you want to access. In this 
  case I'll create a svn.bitworking.org sub-domain of bitworking.org. I have a <a href="http://cornerhost.com">
  great hosting provider</a> that let's me do this myself from a web based control panel.
  After creating the sub-domain you add some lines to your
  ssh config file <em>on the client</em> to select which key to use based on the domain name:
</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat ~/.shh/config
Host svn.bitworking.org
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa
Host bitworking.org
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_bash
</code></pre>
<p>Now just refer to you subversion server using the sub-domain name and the key for
   subversion will be used. Ssh to the main domain name and the key for bash will be used.

    <p>Why don't you ask Michal to install Subversion so you don't have to rely on your local install? When I asked him why Vim wasn't installed, he put it on all the servers.</p>
<p>I've recently switched from cornerhost to tektonic.net because they offer User-mode Linux accounts. Michal was awesome but not having root access was disheartening. Setting up Apache2 and Subversion was a breeze with Debian.</p>

    <p>Why not just update $PATH in you .bash_profile (or some such)?</p>
<p>It gets executed even when you do scp.  Here's what happens after I put "echo HEY" at the end of my .bashrc:</p>
<p>  $ scp superman.everybody.org:.bashrc b<br />
  HEY<br />
  $</p>
<p>(scp quits working since they "HEY" confuses it.)</p>

    <p>According to the SVN faq:</p>
<p><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#ssh-svnserve-location">http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#ssh-svnserve-location</a></p>
<p>It says that SSH ignores anything in the .bash_profile. So adding stuff there, won't work.</p>
<p>And, I know from experience. I have the svnserve in my path. but I still can't use the svn+ssh.</p>

    In my installation svnserve is in /usr/local/bin which seems not to be in the ssh path. Creating a symbolic link in /usr/bin to svnserve solves the problem because /usr/bin is in the ssh path.<br />
After doing this svn+ssh:// works fine.
