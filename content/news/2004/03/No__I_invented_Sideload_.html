  <p>Don't tell <a href="http://trevor.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/sideload_please.html">Trevor</a>, but this a feature of a cranky old part of the internet called <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc959/2_Overview.html">FTP</a>.
Now obviously BitTorrent has it's advantages, just funny to see old ideas become new again.</p>

    <p>Sideloading has nothing to do with which transfer protocol you're using.Â  It's just a user interface hack for online gathering/storage services which allows them to take net load off of their users' connections and provide a handy service from their browser UI.</p>
<p>The scenarios in my post mentioned HTTP and bittorrent, but part of the magic of passing URLs is that they include a scheme portion, so if it's FTP you're stuck on, it's FTP for you.</p>
<p>As far as recycling ideas go, I posted because sideloading is an old idea that I was surprised people didn't know about.</p>
