  <p>The NYTimes has an interesting article on a team of electrical engineers at the California Institute of Technology creating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/26/technology/circuits/26next.html">a single chip with all the functions of a radar system</a>. Not only can it be used for typical radar uses, it can also be used for high speed communications.</p>
<blockquote><p>"D.S.L. can go to several hundred kilobits, and fiber can go to
several gigabits per second," Dr. Hajimiri said. The radar chip can
achieve bit rates up to a gigabit per second, partly because of the
concentrated nature of the beam, he said. "The beam created by the chip
is highly focused," he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, so it's currently in the lab, but this looks like 
  something that can seriously solve the last-mile problem.
  It will be interesting to watch.</p>
