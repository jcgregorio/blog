  <p><a href="http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a> 
  which used to be hosted at http://lambda.weblogs.com is now 
  alive and kicking at 
  <a href="http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/">http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/</a>.
  They have also, not surprisingly, moved off their old software and are
  now running on <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. This is the second
  community site I've come across very recently that is running on Drupal. The
  other site is Doc Searls' <a href="http://garage.docsearls.com/">IT Garage</a>.
