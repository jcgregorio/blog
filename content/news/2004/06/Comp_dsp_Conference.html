  <p>The first ever <a href="http://www.danvillesignal.com/index.php?id=compdsp">comp.dsp conference</a> is being held from July 28th to August 1st. Probably not the first conference to be held around a usenet newsgroup, but still pretty unique. One thing that really stood out
is the heavy dose of social and family events. Bonus points to <a href="http://www.analog.com">Analog Devices</a> and <a href="http://www.arrow.com/">Arrow</a> for being the first companies to contribute, in this case items for door prizes.</p>
