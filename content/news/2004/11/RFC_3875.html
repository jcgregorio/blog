  <p><a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3875.txt">RFC 3875</a> was published back in October. Yeah, I'm a little late in picking it up. RFC 3875 is The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1, an informational RFC. Notable for two reasons. The first being that this is the first RFC to deal with CGI. Ever. Which may strike you as odd since CGI is a core piece of technology used every day when building web applications, and has been used since 1993. The second reason being it was co-authored by <a href="http://ken.coar.org/">Ken Coar</a>.</p>
