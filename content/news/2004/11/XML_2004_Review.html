  <p>To be quite honest, I went into XML 2004 with greatly diminished 
   expectations. After submitting and being accepted to speak I found out
   that no travel or hotel expenses would be covered by the conference, nor was there
   even a token honorarium. The on-site situation didn't raise much 
   hope either, parking at the hotel was a hit-and-miss operation as the
   over priced hotel parking lot was often full, and the wi-fi situation, for
   a contemporary conference, was scandalous.
</p>
<p>But that was the down side. All of that was made up for, and more, by
   the upside, which was the ability to meet face-to-face for the first time
   with many of the people I'd gotten to know electronically over that last 
   two or more years, including Tim Bray, Norm Walsh, David Orchard, Len Bullard, Dare       Obasanjo, Henry Thompson, Paul Cotton, John Cowan, 
   Robert Sayre, Ezra Cooper, Kendall Clark,
   Simon St. Laurent, Bill Kearney and Micah Dubinko. I tried to keep that list in the order
   that I met people. Please leave me note if 
   I've been a cad and forgotten you. 
</p>
<p>What the extensive list means is that I only went to two talks
   at the entire conference, my own, and the one immediately preceeding
   my own, which I was required to attend as a part of speaking. 
   Every day was filled, from early morning to midnight or later, at the Atom hack-a-thon, 
   in the hallways of the conference, or at surrounding 
   establishments, talking tech. It was great conference and I'm looking forward to 
   XML 2005.
</p>
<p>My presentation on the Atom Publishing Protocol was well received and I've posted
   the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/XML2004/presentation/pre.html">slides</a>. 
   Note the slides are in the trendy new <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S<sup>5</sup></a> format so you can 
view them in a browser, but you'll need
   JavaScript on to view the slides formatted properly.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/20/Tribal">Tim Bray has a post up on XML 2004</a> which includes a picture of me giving my presentation.</p>

    Opera doesn't advertise the fact that you need to view the slides using their 'Opera Show' technology. Press F11 to go full screen and it presents the show quite nicely.
