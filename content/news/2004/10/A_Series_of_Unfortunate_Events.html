<p>Based on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/11/lemony_snicket_11.html">a recommendation from Cory Doctorow</a> I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064407667/bitworking-20">The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 1)</a>, by Lemony Snicket, under the guise of getting it for my oldest son to read for school. In fact it was primarily for me and it was a great read, taking me only an hour or two to finish the book. I hope my son enjoys it so I can rationalize buying more of the series.

    Thie is one of the best books I've ever read. It just draws you in, I read the first one in seven hours! I definitly recommend this book. Don't do what Lemony tells you to do. The books are great so read them!!!!!!!!
