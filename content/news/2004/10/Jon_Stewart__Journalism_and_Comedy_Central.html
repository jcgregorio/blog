  <p>When the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/15/jon_stewarts_crossfi.html">
   loudest voice for responsibility in journalism</a>
   is the guy who's show on Comedy Central comes on right
   after <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/crankyankers">Crank Yankers</a>, 
   there's something seriously wrong. After reading the trascript I so wanted to 
   see the real video footage that I installed <a href="http://bittorrent.com/">
   BitTorrent</a> for the very first time.</p>
