  <p>This is the day, Gotcha Day, the day we get Caden.</p>

<p>She came right to us, with no crying at all.</p>

<p>It was very cute, she sat on Lynne's lap and just stared at 
me for a good 5 minutes. Then she reached out for me. We sent pictures
out to the orphanage earlier and I think the Aunties did a good job
of showing her the pictures because she seemed to recognize us.</p>

<p>After getting the babies we went to complete
the official adoption paperwork. We have now officially
adopted her in China. Now we wait for some of the 
paperwork to get back to us and then on to
Guangzhou to adopt her in the US.</p>
<p>What you don't see in the pictures is that I am deathly 
ill. I caught the stomach bug. For
the last picture just seconds before it I was sleeping 
on a chair in the lobby, shivering with the chills. I went
back there immediately after the picture was taken. After 
we returned to the hotel I slept for 15 hours. I'm feeling
better now and can hopefully more fully enjoy this time with our daughter.</p>
