  <p>I have previously complained about <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/46">
   XForms only supporting
   3 HTTP verbs</a>. When I <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms-editor/2003Feb/0014.html">
   complained</a> close to a year ago (and 8 months before 
   XForms 1.0 became a recommendation) I was assured in private email
   that this would be fixed in the next revision. Lo and behold the 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms-11-req/">XForms 1.1 Requirements</a>
   are out with nary a mention of fixing this problem. Of course, they plan
   on spending all their time adding support for SOAP to XForms.

   effort gets the attention it so richly deserves</a>.

    hi--through google, i arrived at an archival post of yours about the etymology of kibosh, according to steve, but couldn't actually find out the etymology.  i keep coming across "origin unknown" for this word, but have a fairly distinct memory of reading an etymology years ago.  sorry to intrude on your blog and your time, but if there's any validity to steve's etymology, could you pass it on?  thank you for your time.  annie
