  <p>Today was a very low key day.</p>
  
<p> I wanted to
keep a low profile as I am still recovering
from the stomach flu, and we also want time
with Caden, so Lynne and I skipped out on the
scheduled site-seeing and stuck around the 
hotel. In the morning we walked around the nearby
pedestrian mall with Mark and Moya doing some
window shopping and stopping by the
grocery store on the way back for necessities.
I'm still not coherent enough, I forgot to
bring along the camera, a sure sign that 
staying back was a good idea. The rest of the day
was spent playing with and taking care of Caden,
eating and exploring the hotel (you laugh, but this 
place is 39 stories tall, has 8 restaurants and 
about that many shops). </p>

We took <strong>a lot</strong> of pictures of 
Caden, but because she is always laughing and playing
so hard most of the shots end up looking like this
one.

    I have to keep saying it -- she's beautiful, and looks thoroughly happy!  I couldn't be more happy for you.  This has definitely been a long gestation :)
