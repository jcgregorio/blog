<blockquote><p>And by the way, as of the writing of this Iâ€™m not aware of any APP server implementations that get green check-marks all the way down the line from the Ape.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can run the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">APE</a> against my apptestsite:</p><p></p><p><code>http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestsite/app.cgi/service/;service_document</code></p>
<p>No name or password are required. You will see that some things don't look quite right:</p>
  <dl>
<dt>1. Content-type must be 'application/atomserv+xml', not 'application/atomsvc+xml'</dt>
<dd> That's not true as of draft-14.</dd>
<dt>11. 'summary' has type='html' in entry as posted, type='xhtml' in returned entry.</dt>
<dd> I presume the <tt>?</tt> is just an informational message and not a warning or an error? For reference, the 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestclient/">APP Test Client</a> breaks messages down into three categories: Informational, Warning (breaks a SHOULD/SHOULD NOT) and Error (breaks a MUST/MUST NOT).</dd>
<dt>12. 'content' in entry as posted [ ... ] differs from that in returned entry [ ... ].</dt>
<dd> The problem here is that my implementation normalizes the content and turns all chracter entities into their real characters, unless that would cause a problem. For example, the &amp;gt; gets turned into &gt; as opposed to being preserved as a character entity. A little more robust string comparison would eliminate this false negative.
</dd>
<dt>28. Can't update new entry with PUT: <del>Not Found</del> Method not allowed</dt>
<dd><del>Where did <i>that</i> URI come from?</del> Fixed the bad URI returned on my side, but now we have a problem with conditional PUTs.</dd>
</dl>
<p><del>I do have one bug to fix and that is the relative URI being returned in the Location: header upon a successful create.</del>
 Fixed.

    <p>Hey, cool stuff.  Fixed #1.  </p>
<p>On #11, at the moment the '?' means "something that an implementor might well need to know about".  I'm not sure that introducing more granularity corresponding to SHOULD-or-not would be helpful to the potential implementor who I see as the Ape's most common user.</p>
<p>On #12, there was a problem, but it's not what you think.  The problem was that the Ape was treating white-space between &lt;content type="xhtml"&gt; and the enclosed &lt;xhtml:div&gt; as significant in the comparison... the spec maybe gives a little wiggle room on this, but I think that restricting the comparison to the div gives a more useful result.</p>
<p>Conditional-PUT now works.  Having now actually read 9.5 in draft-14 carefully, I urge all other potential implementors to do the same.</p>

    I noticed the atom:author/atom:name changed, and so did atom:updated. Interested to know your reasoning for usurping those two.

<p>Ok, I fixed the text-title escaping problems, so now were down to 
  just warnings about dropped categories and foreign markup. Those 
  I don't plan on fixing those since it's the client that SHOULD round-trip
  the foreign markup, not the server. 
</p>
<p>The one last problem is interesting:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Client-provided slug 'ape-92515' not used in server-generated URI.</dt>
<dd>This is interesting since I <b>do</b> use the slug on the 
    URI of the generated web page, i.e. the "alternate" link, but 
    it was redundant to use it on the "edit" link. I may change that
    just for the sake of completeness.

    Eric,<br />
<p>The atom:author/atom:name is hard coded into the templates. I suppose
  if 1812 was designed to be a multi-author blogging 
  platform then that would end up being configurable.
</p>
<p>As for atom:updated, I consider that a server controlled
  element and I set that to the local time when an entry
  is edited for any reason, because I sort 
  entries by atom:updated when generating the collection feed.
  Now <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg08488.html">if collections were sorted by atom:edited</a>, then I could 
  let atom:updated revert to being client controlled.

    <p>I decided that Joe was right and the Ape was wrong about the Slug.  Who cares if the slug shows up in the edit-URI?  The reason it exists is to personalize the URI the world sees, especially the search-engine bots.  So I just checked in a change where it runs through all the rel="alt" links (including those with no rel=) and if it finds the slug in one of the hrefs it's happy.</p>
<p>Also, fixing up the conditional-PUT thing has convinced me that the first sentence of 9.5 in draft-14 isn't strong enough.  The etag stuff isn't there to make editing easier, it's there to help allow safe concurrent editing, and the spec should say so.</p>
