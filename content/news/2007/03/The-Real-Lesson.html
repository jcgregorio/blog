  <p><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/web/put-is-not-update/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a> [via <a href="http://16cards.com/2007/03/10/the-cafes-put-is-not-update/">Brandon</a>] :</p>
<blockquote><p>PUT remains one of the most confusing HTTP verbs because it is so frequently misdescribed, even by <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/01/restful-web.html">people who really do know better</a>. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <b>real</b> lesson here is to check all my analogies with Elliotte first. The upside is that I can stop writing the disclaimers, which don't seem to get read anyways.

    He is of course right. All of the APP developers should take that lesson and do something about it in the APP specification. What if we explain "PUT" as an "overwrite" instead of an "update"?
