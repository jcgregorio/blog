<dd><blockquote><p>REST provides a set of architectural <b>constraints</b> that, when applied as a whole, 
    emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent 
    deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, 
    enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</p></blockquote></dd>

<dd><blockquote><p>We treat component failures as the norm rather than the
    exception, optimize for huge ﬁles that are mostly appended
    to (perhaps concurrently) and then read (usually sequen-
    tially), and both extend and relax the standard ﬁle system
    interface to improve the overall system.</p></blockquote>
<p>
    The system is tuned for a modest number of large files
    and presumes large streaming reads and small random reads, and
    many large sequential appends.</p>

<p>At the lowest level in git there are only <ins>three</ins><del>two</del> operations on the content store:
    create, read, and delete. You don't even get to choose the name of
    a file when it is created, all the data is written into
    a file (deflated with zlib) where the filename is the sha1 hash
    of the contents.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Performance, either defined as speed or as scalibility, is achieved
in each system because of the chosen constraints.</p>
<p>What are your constraints? And what are they buying you?</p>

    Too bad that Roy didn't write instead. "REST provides a set of architectural benefits that, when…" or something similar. Maybe it would have been easier for people to accept it.
