  <p>Found via my referrer logs, <a href="http://www.cheeserater.com/">Cheeserater</a>, a Django based application that lets you rate Python packages listed in the cheeseshop.
</p>
<p>Oddly, <a href="http://www.cheeserater.com/packages/selector/">selector</a>, which has a rather sparse cheeseshop entry, doesn't show up in a <a href="http://www.cheeserater.com/packages/search/?q=selector">search</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, my first impulse was to get an account and vote <i>down</i>
<a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>. I wish I had the bandwidth to try to help, but I don't. Instead, I'll just repeat my advice: 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Please_stop_using_setuptools__at_least_exclusively__for_now____">If you are maintaining a package that uses setuptools for install, please provide a distuils alternative</a>.

    If you use workingenv, it'll set up all the pieces of the environment for you, solving most of your problems with ez_setup.py
