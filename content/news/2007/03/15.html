  <p>Why did I just drop $15 on a 5 year old album?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewwk.com/">Good UI</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and good music, but I wouldn't have really known that without the UI.</p>
<p>None of this explains why I never heard of 
Andrew W. K. before yesterday, yet today heard one of his songs
on the radio twice, off that same five year old album.

    Andrew W.K.'s music is okay, but the website really sucks. Seriously. The UI is just horrible.

<p>I was just talking about the UI of the music samples, which are full length songs from various albums played continuously. I just opened the page and went off to do other work. After 4 or five songs I knew I was going to have to buy a CD. 
</p>
<p>Compare this to the very manual and unsatisfying experience of repeatedly clicking on 15 second samples on Amazon.com, just to be left feeling uneasy, wondering if they sampled only the good (or bad) parts of the songs.
