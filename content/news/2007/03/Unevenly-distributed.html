<p>How many in your house?</p>
<p>To see where I am going with this, try counting the 
   number of electric motors in your house. Unless you're
   <a href="http://www.flashenabled.com/">Phil Torrone</a>, 
   you'll be wrong, and not just off by one or two, probably off by 
   half or more.

    Lets see.  IP addresses:  My personal Mac laptop, my work Windows laptop, my wife's Mac laptop, my wife's Windows laptop, my wife's Windows desktop, the Linux printserver, the NAS box, the Vonage box, Cable modem, upstairs Wi-Fi router/AP, downstairs Wi-Fi AP.  That's 11.  Soon to be joined by an Asterisk server and something Tivo-esque.

Electric motors: The fridge, the convection oven, the microwave (fan and turntable), blender, food processor, garbage disposal, 2 central AC units, vacuum cleaner.  (I won't include the CD player, DVD player, all the computer hard disks, and CD/DVD players, and the unused fans.)  So that's 9.

Did you expect fewer motors?

    Pete,<br />
<p> The last CD player I took apart had six electric motors in it. Also, every computer on your list has one motor per harddrive, one or two per CD-ROM, and one per fan. I'd say a real count was closer to Bill's guess of 80-100.
</p>
<p> Now think about the fact that there are plenty of devices without electric motors that would do well to have internet connectivity, such as a thermostat, smoke detector, CO detector, or a light switch.
</p>
<p> My point: We're 130 years out from the first commercially viable 
electric motor and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=electric%20window%20blind">we're still finding places to put them</a>. We're barely at the beginning of networking our houses. What does broadband and home networking look like with 100+ networked devices?

    <p>I intentionally left out the motors in the computers and disc players, because I didn't know where you were going with this and figured you didn't want these counted (and who new a CD player had 6 of 'em).  But then, looking at Bill's list, it looks like I woefully undercounted anyway - I even forgot the washer and dryer, not to mention half-a-dozen kitchen gadgets, tools, cameras, and so on.</p>
<p>I really thought you were going the other way; putting motors alongside buggy whips.</p>

    Don't forget that your cable settop box has an IP address.  I'm not so sure about your DirectTV boxes.

<p>I've got the all-in-one DirecTv/Tivo units, so those are covered by my list.

<p>Cool! I'd be fascinated to hear how that gets used on a daily basis.</p>
