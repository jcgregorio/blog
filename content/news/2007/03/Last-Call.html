  <p>The
<a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg08493.html">Atom Publishing Protocol has entered Last Call</a>.</p>
<p>There were days when I doubted we'd ever make 
   it this far.</p>

    But is it ready for RFC status yet, you think? I believe there has been so many issues brought up lately that it should be pushed back and worked on for at least one more month. Do you disagree?

<p>I disagree. If you look carefully at the mailing list you will
   see that the 'issues' fall into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Editorial nits ( things that, if changed, might make the spec
    easier to read or understand, but don't actually change the operation. )
   </li>
<li>James Snell</li>
</ol>

    Now <em>I</em> disagree. You are mostly right, but there are two real issues, one of them raised by Elliotte and the other by you: the CSV content model of <code>app:accept</code> and the ordering of entries by <code>app:edit</code> rather than <code>atom:updated</code>.

    Aristotle,<br />
<p>True, those don't fit into my categorization, 
   but I believe both of those are issues that can
   be fixed as part of Last Call.
