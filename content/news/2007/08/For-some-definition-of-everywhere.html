  <p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere">Jonathan Schwartz</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>JAVA is a technology whose value is near infinite to the internet...</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe you meant "intranet"?</p>
<p><b>My</b> internet is composed of browsers and 
LAMP stacks, where LAMP = (Linux, Apache/Lighty, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python),
and none of those pieces, not even the browsers, are written in Java.
