  <p>It's all about the construction.</p>
<p><i>[ For the impatient, the executive summary is that I'm starting at Google
  at the end of the month. I won't be relocating. I'll provide more details as I 
  learn them, and as I learn what I can, and can't, share.
   ]</i>
</p>
  <p>
My first job was working at Tecan U.S. writing software
for spectrophotometers and liquid handling robots. At the time
Lynne and I lived in North Raleigh and my commute took me around
the north west part of the Raleigh belt-line. For the entire two 
and a half years that I worked at Tecan the belt-line was under 
construction as it was widened from two lanes to three. Of course, that 
meant that most of the time the road was littered with construction barrels
and cones and usually narrowed down to one lane. 
</p>
<p><img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/2007/08/beltline.png" /></p>
<p>
Two weeks after I left Tecan they finished the widening and all the barrels came down.
</p>
<p>
My next job was at MTS writing software for mechanical 
testing systems, and since we had moved to Apex, the easiest 
commute was up Cary Parkway, then to wend my way through
Preston subdivision. I was thrilled when construction 
on the Cary Parkway connector was finished and it cut a good
five minutes off my commute.
</p>
<p><img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/2007/08/caryparkway.png" /></p>
<p>
Two weeks later they started the process of closing our
division and I was laid off.
</p>
<p>Two for two; I'm starting to get a little suspicious.</p>
<p>
SAMSys seemed like a safe bet for a place to work, I'd be writing 
software for RFID readers, it was up in Durham and I'd actually 
found no construction projects
planned along my intended commute. Of course, within the first year
the company moved and my new commute took me straight down Route 55,
set for widening from one lane to two in both directions. 
SAMSys went bankrupt, then was bought out of bankruptcy by a competitor,
Sirit. Meanwhile the road construction project ran into nearly a year of 
delays, but once the barrels came down I was laid off from Sirit within a month.
</p>
<p><img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/2007/08/rt55.png" /></p>
<p>
And so last year I was hired by IBM. Sweet, my commute
would continue to be Route 55, thus ensuring a long career there.
What I didn't realize was that the Route 540 extension that was going to 
intersect Route 55 was under construction and when complete
would take a good five minutes off my commute.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.localtechwire.com/traffic/story/1593367/">That new section of road opened up on July 16th</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can see where this is going.
</p>
<p>
I start at Google at the end of this month.

    Getting real, real tired of saying "How exciting for you!" to folks I've worked with.  Though, of course, I am excited for you.  :-)

Hoping you don't go as silent as some of the other googlers ...

    Just wanted to thank you for your work at Samsys. I have worked with quite a few RFID readers in the past, and the Samsys devices were definitely on the better side (especially protocol-wise). Actually, the network protocols that lots of RFID devices speak must have been designed by, um, let's call them hardware engineers with no sense for software. Not so the Samsys readers. Sorry that it didn't work out for the company.

Congratulations and best wishes for your new job at Google. Hope there won't be any road construction projects soon ;-)

    Amazing! Google seems to really understand the difference between being "on the web" and "of the web." Not only in their technology but also in their hiring. If this keeps up, we may need to limit announcements to those who *do not* get hired by Google.
