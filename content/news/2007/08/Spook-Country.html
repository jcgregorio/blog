  <p>Like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/11/New-Book">Tim</a>,
I just finished reading William Gibson's <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/spook.asp">
Spook Country</a>. Filled with those trademark riverstone-smooth sentences and spiked
with a cynicism that can only come from two terms of a Bush presidency it's less 
science fiction and more 
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Copying_vs._mark-and-sweep_vs._mark-and-don.27t-sweep">mark and sweep</a> dump of the unevenly distributed
future that's already here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hollis thought he looked like William Burroughs, minus the bohemian substrate (or perhaps the methadone). Like someone who'd be invited quail shooting with the vice-president, though too careful to get himself shot.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's like a year of <a href="http://boingboing.net">boing-boing</a>, with a plot.</p>

    Hi, enjoyed your blog post re: William Gibson. I am a big fan too and have followed his work very closely for years.

If you are interested, I am posting chapter summaries of Spook Country at http://node.tumblr.com. There are definitely tons of spoilers, maps and pictures of key locations in the real Spook Country, and links to related topics. You might also want to check out Memetic Engineerâ€™s Spook Country website [http://www.spookcountry.co.uk/] with a UK angle on the book.
