<p>This is a screen shot of my logfiles, recording here for all posterity
    the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparklines web service</a> crossing the auspicious milestone
    of one million hits a week.
</p>
<p>That's a web service, written in Python, running as a CGI application, under Apache,
  shelling out a million hits a week, on a shared host, and in no way even causing
  the server to breath hard.
