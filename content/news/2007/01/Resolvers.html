  <p>A University of Calgary professor has recently published his <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/january2007/procrastination-release/">magnum opus on procrastination</a>,
which includes, among other findings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most people’s New Year’s resolutions are doomed to failure</p></blockquote>
<p>Not suprising since I see this every year at the YMCA. For the first month the Y is crowded with 'Resolvers' - people who made it their new year resolution to work out more or to get in shape. By the end of February every one of them will be gone and we'll be back to the 'regulars'.
