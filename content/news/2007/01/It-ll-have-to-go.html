  <p>In Chapter 10 of Douglas Adam's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Universe-Everything-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345418905/">Life, the Universe, and Everything</a> we meet the people of Krikkit whose home planet and sun are surrounded by a dust cloud that blocks their view of the rest of the universe, and in this scene they are flying their first spaceship out past the cloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
History was gathering itself to deliver another blow.
</p>
<p>
Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkess. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone.</p>
<p>They flew out of the cloud.</p>
<p>They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear.
</p>
<p>For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. And then they turned round.
</p>
<p>"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home.
</p>
<p>On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, familiy life and the obliteration of all other life forms.
