I will be going to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a> this year. For the first time I'm travelling to ETech as an IBM employee, and so unlike my last job I won't need to take the time off and pay my own way there. That means I won't be just parachuting in for my presentation and then leaving the next day -  I'll be there all four days. This year I won't be speaking, but there will be a <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg08068.html">face-to-face APP Interop event</a> at the conference.
