My lovely wife <a href="http://lynnesramblings.blogspot.com/">Lynne finally has a blog</a>. After hearing
"you should blog about [blank]" for the Nth time I
gently mentioned that if she had her own blog, she
wouldn't have to wait for me to write about [blank].
So now she's up and running on Blogger and has a bunch of 
posts up already, including reviews of 
<a href="http://lynnesramblings.blogspot.com/2007/01/snoof-no-mom-spoofee.html">Spoofee</a>, 
<a href="http://lynnesramblings.blogspot.com/2006/12/slingbox-what.html">Slingbox</a>, 
<a href="http://lynnesramblings.blogspot.com/2006/12/quest-for-wii.html">Nintendo Wii</a>
, and
<a href="http://lynnesramblings.blogspot.com/2006/12/voip-voice-over-ip-what-is-it-all-about.html">ViaTalk</a>.
</p>
<p>What she fails to mention in the Slingbox review
is that it requires an ethernet connection. Luckily
I started wiring the whole house for ethernet
while I was laid off, and while I haven't finished, I did
have the tools and materials on hand to install
a new drop by the TV in about 45 minutes.
</p>
<p>And yes, I really did withhold a link to her
  blog until she updated her post to disclose that the ViaTalk link
  is part of an referral program. What is the world coming to
  when traffic is a commodity in your house? I expect her writing 
  to appeal to a much larger audience and 
  that the tables will be turned shortly.
