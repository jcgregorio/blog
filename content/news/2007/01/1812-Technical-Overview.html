  <p>
The source for <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/1812/">1812</a>, the code that now runs this 
blog is now available. Note that I don't expect you 
to use it, the code is highly customized to my 
needs, but there may be cool bits you want to borrow.
</p>

  
<p>First the name: 1812. I listened to the 1812 Overture,
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Confession_of_an_Infinite_Looper">repeatedly</a>,
while coding, so thus the name.
</p>
<h3 id="store">Store Format</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/1812/mcoll.py">underlying datastore in 1812</a> is a
flat file database that has one file per entry. The 
format is an RFC 2822 file with headers at the beginning
followed by [crlf][crlf] and then the body. The body
contains the summary and the content, in that order, separated
by a single ^L character. Both the summary and content
are well-formed XHTML - at least when stuffed into a div - and
are serialized as utf-8. You should note that ^L is not a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets">valid
<del>unicode</del> <ins>XML</ins></a> character so we don't need to worry about those appearing
in the summary or content. 
</p>
<p>Entries are sorted by both their published and their updated times.
   This is done by populating directories with sym-links to the entry files.
   The name of each sym-link is the published/updated time in ISO format.
   That means getting a list of entries in updated order is a matter
   of getting a listing of a directory and sorting the names in alphabetical order.
</p>
<h3 id="uris">URIs</h3>
<p>Another aspect of 1812 is the URI structure. I have wrestled
  with this and if any one issue has stalled a rollout of a 
  new set of software for this blog then URI structure would have 
  to be it. There's always a tension between <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs</a>
  that don't change and the proper generation of unique
  ids. All of my old URIs are of the form 
  <tt>/news/[id]</tt> where the id was some 'slug'ified
  version of the title. While that works, you run into problems
  if you generate a second post with the same title. What do you
  do, start appending numeric counters? <tt>/news/stuff</tt>, <tt>/news/stuff-2</tt>,
  <tt>/news/stuff-3</tt>, etc. What if the title of
  my post is 'Shrek-2', does my second post on 'Shrek-2' go 
  to 'Shrek-3' or 'Shrek-2-1'? You can see the rathole looming large.
  On the other hand, generating 
  URIs completely off a database index leads to un-Cool, or at least
  search unfriendly, URIs: <tt>/news/1</tt>,  <tt>/news/2</tt>, etc. 
</p>
<p>The solution was partly inspired by Amazon, which recently 
   starting adding slugs to their book URIs. For example:
   </p>
<p><code><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gravitys-Rainbow-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0140283382/">http://www.amazon.com/Gravitys-Rainbow-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0140283382/</a></code></p>
<p>Note the search friendly "Gravitys-Rainbow-Thomas-Pynchon" slug in the path. The problem with the 
  Amazon solution is that they don't enforce the slug, that is, you can change it to
  anything you want as the id code at the end of the URI is the only thing used to 
  look up the item. The following URI leads to the same place:
  </p>
<p><code><a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-could-say-nasty-stuff-here/dp/0140283382/">http://www.amazon.com/I-could-say-nasty-stuff-here/dp/0140283382/</a></code></p>
<p>That's a little too loose and open to mischief, so 1812 takes a hybrid approach,
   with URIs of the form: </p>
<pre><code>/news/[id]/[slug]</code></pre>
<p>The code uses the <code>id</code> to look up the entry and then
   looks up the slug in the entry to make sure it matches.
   If it doesn't then it generates a 404. That 
   gives me cool URIs, fast look up, and yet doesn't let anybody
   monkey with my URIs. 
</p>
<p>To keep my old URIs still working I allowed an entry 
to have a blank slug, a feature I used when importing my 
old entries into the new system.
</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Once you have a generic store that's easy to use, well, that's a hammer,
   and when you have a hammer everything starts to look like a nail.
   Comments are just such a case. For each entry in the main blog
   there is an associated collection of comments, i.e. one collection
   per entry. Collections are cheap.
</p>
<h3 id="other">Other bits</h3>
<p>There are other bits I will cover later, but the whole
  thing is built using <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/robaccia/">Robaccia</a> 
  (and thus <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI</a>),  
  and <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a>.
  I'm currently using both Kid and Cheetah as I haven't decided
  which templating package to use, and may end up using more than
  one in the end.
