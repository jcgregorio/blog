  <p>There are days where I want to chuck it all and take up music.</p>
<p> I'd like to play the cannon. 
</p><p>I realize that would severly limit my repertoire to just two songs; "The 1812 Overture", and AC/DC's "For those about to rock", but I'm ok with that. Hyperspecialization is the new black.</p>

    <p>I always assumed Simon and Garfunkel's "The Boxer" had cannon shots following its refrain. ("lie-la-lie <strong>*BOOM*</strong> lie-la-lie-lie, lie-la-lie")</p>
<p>It doesn't, but that's no reason for you not to branch out.</p>

    <p>Over the summer I was browsing iTunes for a good recording of the 1812, as I'd moved at the start of the year and a lot of my (as-yet-unripped) CDs were in storage on the other end of the country. I found one whose artist listing was (I kid you not) "Churchbells of Gothenburg, Gothenburg Artillery Division, Gothenburg Symphony Brass Band, Gothenburg Symphony Chorus &amp; Ove Gotting".</p>
<p>My first thought on seeing it was that more music needs to be scored for artillery division. It's an untapped market.</p>

    Sure, you might be limited on covers...  What about originals?
