  <p>The last little bit I needed to add to bring <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/1812/">1812</a>
   up to par with the old blogging code base was <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/archives/">archives</a>.
   The inspiration for this design came from <a href="http://w-uh.com/archive.cgi">Ole</a>.

    Isn't reading every file in the Collection for your blog entries a little slow?

<p>Completely non-scientific timings on my part puts it at less than 500ms, which is completely acceptable for a page that won't be accessed very often. I may end up doing some more accurate timings when I dig into performance in general.

    I like it :)

P.S. to Neil - I did a slight optimization in that I save the page when it is generated, and check to see if the saved page is never than my home page.  So after a new post, only the first hit costs the time of regeneration, after that it is just a copy.

Joe: Fair enough, half a second doesn't sound like the end of the world.
</p>
<p>
Ole: That sounds about right. I bake (build once) my entire site but that's the next best thing for a dynamic site. If you're doing it properly you have to check whether any of your templates have changed recently too.
