<p>I was helping Reilly, my first grader, build a Space Alien from items around the house; a school assignment due tomorrow. As a final touch we were gluing a rubber band to his head to form a mouth.</p>
<p>"Make him smiling."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because he's happy."</p>
<p>"Why is he happy?"</p>
<p>"Because he just finished sucking someones brains out of their head."</p>
<p>"You and I are <i>so</i> ending up in the school counselor's office."</p>
