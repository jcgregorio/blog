  <p>Having kids means you hear sentences around the house that you
would never hear uttered otherwise.</p>
<h3>On safety</h3>
<p>From the four year old:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is there blood and bandages all over the bathroom? 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Answer: The 13 year old just got a <i>real</i> Swiss Army knife for his birthday.
   With <i>real</i> Swiss blades. Which can <i>really</i> cut  
   not-so-Swiss hands. Which he tried to bandage up himself to avoid the embarassment. 
   Apparently the embarassment wasn't deep enough to compel him
   to try to hide the incident  <i>by actually cleaning up after himself</i>.

<h3>On nature</h3>
<p>Yelled out the back door:</p>
<blockquote><p>Put your clothes back on on the trampoline.</p></blockquote>
<h3>On siblings</h3>
<blockquote><p>How many times have I told you, don't lick your brother.</p></blockquote>
<h3>On the subject of eating bugs</h3>
<p>Talking with the 11 year old about his day:</p>
<blockquote><p>So there was this bug...</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Did you eat it?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That was <b>one</b> ant, <b>two</b> years ago, sheeesh!</p></blockquote>
