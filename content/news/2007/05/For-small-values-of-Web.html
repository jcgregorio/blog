    <p>I want to believe.  I swear, I do.  Help me!

</p><p>Consider an API as complex as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">the Flickr API</a>.  How do you "do this in REST" without somehow describing the structure of some of the data returned?  For example, take the structure returned from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.people.getInfo.html">flickr.people.getInfo</a> api.  

</p><p>If I was to take you and Mark Baker at your word, the documentation provided by the Flickr API site wouldn't be required, since "all you need to know is HTTP/1.1".

</p><p>I'm not buying it.

</p><p>And of course, the real world is much more complex than the Flickr API.  Ratchet the complexity of the returned data up a factor or two.

</p><p>Or, cutting closer to the bone, why bother having an APP spec, when it's, after all, just REST (well, I assume it's RESTy ~smile~).  Shouldn't need a spec, should we?</p>

    Patrick,<br />
<p>If you can find me, 'at my word', where I say, "all you need to know is HTTP/1.1", then I'll buy you a drink.</p>
<p>What I wanted to talk about today was strong typing, I'll address the flow/interaction issue in a later post.</p>
<blockquote><p>And of course, the real world is much more complex than the Flickr API.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure where you live, but Flickr is in <b>my</b> 'real world'.</p>
<p>I will concede that there are services that are more complex, 
but WSDL/XML-Schema is brittle in the face of that complexity, just ask <a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/whySoapSucks.html">Nelson</a>.
