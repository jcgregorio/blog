  <p>The 15th, and hopefully <b>last</b> draft 
  <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">of the APP is now available</a>.
   If I understand the process correctly  it is now out of the WG's hands and our Area Director  	
   Lisa Dusseault does the shepherding through the rest of the process in the IESG. If all goes 
  well, at some point in the future, the APP will appear as an RFC.
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi?command=view_id&amp;dTag=11965&amp;rfc_flag=0">
  You can watch the process here</a>. Hmm, it sure would be useful if that was available as a feed.

    Wow, it seems like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/27/APP-12">only yesterday</a> that I was hearing this song before.

<p>The song you heard before was about <i>going</i> to last call, today we are finally <b>past</b> last call.</p>
