  <p>There is no GPhone. That is, there isn't a Google branded handset. There is Android.  From the <a href="http://www.android.com/index.html">Open Handset Alliance</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Android is built on the open Linux Kernel. Furthermore, it utilizes a custom virtual machine that has been designed to optimize memory and hardware resources in a mobile environment. Android will be open source; it can be liberally extended to incorporate new cutting edge technologies as they emerge.</p></blockquote>
<p>The license is Apache 2.</p>

    I worked with a bunch of the Android people at Danger. I spent many hours with Brian Swetland (the guy in the video who gleefully talks about users running Gtk and unix command line apps) bemoaning the crappy Danger 3rd party developer platform (which Apple seems to be knocking off fairly directly). If he's happy then I'm sure what we're going to see will be great from an Free Software and community developer perspective.

    <p>Presumably Linux stays GPL2 :-)  The Android "library" / "stack" being ASLv2?

</p><p>Guessing it'll be fun to be in the embedded software dev world real soon.  Sort of wish OTI / IBM had waited 10 years; it was exactly 10 years ago that I took an assignment at OTI to do embedded software dev.  More or less an impossible market to crack open at the time (and up until now); best of luck to Google and OHA!  Crack away!</p>
