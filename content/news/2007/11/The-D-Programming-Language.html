  <p>D is a programming language from <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/">Digital Mars</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>D is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python. Special attention is given to the needs of quality assurance, documentation, management, portability and reliability.</p></blockquote> <p>From the <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/overview.html">Overview</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>D is a general purpose systems and applications programming language. It is a higher level language than C++, but retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the operating system <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>'s and with hardware. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers. D is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology.</p> <p>D is not a scripting language, nor an interpreted language. It doesn't come with a <acronym title="Virtual Machine">VM</acronym>, a religion, or an overriding philosophy. It's a practical language for practical programmers who need to get the job done quickly, reliably, and leave behind maintainable, easy to understand code. </p></blockquote> <p>It's got strong typing and optional garbage collection but no bubble-tax.</p> <blockquote> <p>D is the culmination of decades of experience implementing compilers for many diverse languages, and attempting to construct large projects using those languages. D draws inspiration from those other languages (most especially C++) and tempers it with experience and real world practicality. </p></blockquote> <p>The language is still evolving, for example, <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/webnews/newsgroups.php?art_group=digitalmars.D&amp;article_id=61016">closures were recently added</a>. It looks pretty impressive, particularly if you've done any C or C++ programming you'll like the way it cleans up many of the awkward pieces of that language family. For example, <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/pastebin/main.cgi/bin/14">here is a program</a> that just does some simple manipulations of arrays of structs. Note the ability to give defaults for struct members, arrays of structs, and the handling of types in the <code>foreach</code> construct. The Digital Mars D compiler does very well at the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=all&amp;calc=Calculate&amp;xfullcpu=1&amp;xmem=1&amp;xloc=0&amp;binarytrees=1&amp;chameneos=1&amp;message=1&amp;fannkuch=1&amp;fasta=1&amp;knucleotide=1&amp;mandelbrot=1&amp;nbody=1&amp;nsieve=1&amp;nsievebits=1&amp;partialsums=1&amp;pidigits=1&amp;recursive=1&amp;regexdna=1&amp;revcomp=1&amp;spectralnorm=1&amp;hello=1&amp;sumcol=1">Debian Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>, and it's up to 12 on the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">TIOBE</a> index, but then again that puts it just one step behind Delphi, so I'm not sure what that means.</p> <p>As much as I like the language I'm also pretty jaded when it comes to changes in the programming language landscape, something I'll comment on more in a future post, but given how long it took C++ to gain any traction I'm not sure any new C-type language will get significant adoption in under ten years. On the other hand, with C linkage there's already a vast amount of code you can use from D. <del>I also wonder if it would be possible to do machine translation of Java into D</del>. <a href="http://dsource.org/projects/tioport">It looks like a project to do that is well under way</a>.</p>

The <a href="http://dsource.org/projects/tioport">TIOPORT</a> project is a Java to D conversion project that has made good progress.  It's written to convert the SWT framework as a target and from the wiki pages the autoconversion mostly works on Linux and GTK.

    This is funny. I am just in the process of porting your URL template WSGI dispatcher to D (well I am also retrofitting it for a D FastCGI library). I often find python stuff converts really well.
