title: RFC 5023 - The Atom Publishing Protocol
date: 2007-10-08T12:00:00-04:00
---

  
  <p>The Atom Publishing Protocol has finally been published
as <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5023.txt">RFC 5023</a>.
</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>Just about a month shy of five years since 
 <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/RESTLog_Overview">the first publication
 of RESTLog</a>. What a long strange trip it's been. RFC's don't have
 dedication sections. If they did I would have dedicated it to my loving wife
 who has endured my strange - and mostly unpaid - obsession for 
 the past five years. This post will have to do. Thanks.

    It's hard for those of us who didn't sweat to appreciate the work, but I am sure it must have been quite a commitment. Thanks for taking the time out of your life to help the rest of us by working towards this standard.

    Another hearty congratulations, Joe! I hope I'll find enough tuits to build an implementation. Is there going to be an interoperability test or reference implementation?

    Vince,<br />
<p>Look on my projects page for both client and server implementations I've done.
An interop session was held back in <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/InteropGrid">April</a>. The projects
listed for that interop are a good place to look for other client and server implementations. I hope we can do more interop sessions in the future.
