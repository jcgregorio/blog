<blockquote><p>
I want templates to be easy for a computer to read and easy for
a computer to generate from that reading a fully-descriptive
page of information in the user's favorite language.  For example,
define a web service that inputs a template and outputs the
readable description according to the Accept-Language received.

I bet Joe could write one of those in an hour --

<p>Who am I to refuse a challenge from Roy Fielding?</p>
<p>Presenting the 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI Template Explainer Web Service</a>. And it really did just take me an hour.
Here is an example taken from my recent proposal:
</p>
<pre>http://bitworking.org/news/{&amp;/|entrypath}
                           \____________/
                                  |      
                                  |      
                                  +-&gt; Join the members of the list ['entrypath'] together with '/'.
</pre>
<p>Yes, it's 2007 and I just wrote a web service that produces ASCII art!</p>
<p>There are more examples on the web service page. The service
itself has been <a href="http://uri-templates.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/explain.cgi">checked into subversion</a>, and has already been
vastly improved by contributions from 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/">Dan Connolly</a>.
</p>
<p>And just to satisfy <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/136/bzr-feed">self-referential integrity</a>, 
here
  is <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/s/explain.cgi?t=http%3A%2F%2Fbitworking.org%2Fprojects%2FURI-Templates%2Fs%2Fexplain.cgi%3Ft%3D%7Buritemplate%7D">the URI Template Explainer explanation for the URI Template for the URI Template Explainer Web Service</a>.

Images of Joe spinning slowly off into space muttering to himself.
