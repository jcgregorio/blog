title: URI Templates Forward Motion

  <p>I just <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Oct/0015.html">
  put forward a proposal on the W3C uri mailing list</a> that I hope will
  move the discussion on URI Templates forward. The proposal 
  comes with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/">
  working code</a> and I believe solves the percent-encoding 
  issues we've had to date.

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    <p>Do you think it's possible to use an URI Template for matching? That's something that'd be cool to have, to standardize things like RoR's routes or selector/wsgidispatch.

</p><p>Alfresco's already doing it with the current draft's syntax (00 or 01) for their <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts">Web Scripts</a> "framework", though I don't know how they do the matches (I suspect they're only doing string comparison on everything before the first "{").</p>

<p>No, in general <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Oct/0044.html">it is not possible to use URI Templates for matching</a>.</p>
