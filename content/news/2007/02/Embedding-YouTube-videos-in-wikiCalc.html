  <p><a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/2007_01_25.htm#iwoorxvideo">Dan Bricklin points</a> to a cool demo
of embedding a YouTube video into a wikiCalc spreadsheet.
Of course, in a show of self-referential-integrity, the demo is done as a screencast and is hosted on YouTube.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile I upgraded to the 1.0 release of wikiCalc
and have my <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1675189&amp;forum_id=584568">sparklines embedding down to a single line</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>B1=wkcHTML(wkctext("&lt;img src='http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/spark.cgi?d=",  
   wkcjoin(A2:A21), "'/&gt;")) 
</code></pre>
<p><del>That requires the <code>wkcJoin()</code> function
which I added to my install, but that doesn't detract from
the fact that</del> we're getting closer and closer to 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Spreadsheet_as_Mashup_Fabric">spreadsheets as mashup fabric</a>.
<ins>See Dan's notes in the comments on how to do this without adding any new functions.</ins>
</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    If you have A16:A20 with numbers, you can have B16 have =A16&amp;"," -- The &amp; is force to string and concatenate. Then you can have:

="&lt;img src='http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/spark.cgi?d=" &amp; wkctext(B16:B20) &amp; "' /&gt;"

Finally, format the cell with Text format "HTML", so you don't need the wkcHTML function. Worked for me.

What standard spreadsheet function gives you the join you want?

<p>That's much better than what I came up with!</p>
<p>I don't believe in limiting my wants to <i>standard</i> spreadsheet functions. 
<code>:)</code> What I'd really like is something that functioned similar
to Python's join:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ",".join(["fred", "barney"])
'fred,barney'
</code></pre>
