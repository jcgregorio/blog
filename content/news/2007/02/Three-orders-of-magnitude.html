  <p>
Current number of people with internet access: 1,000,000,000
</p>
<p>
Median number of employees in a Fortune 10 company: 300,000
</p>
<p>
The ratio is roughly 3000:1.
</p>
<p>
Three orders of magnitude.

Just like when you move from the realm of the atom up to the scale of a cell the rules of the road are different. I'm not claiming the difference in scale between int<b>er</b>net and int<b>ra</b>net is the same as that from atom to cell; there are about 10^14 atoms in a cell, what I am pointing out is that when you move between systems with three orders of magnitude difference in size, the rules are going to change.

I've referenced <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">BigTable</a> a few times recently. 
As you look at Google, <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_eBay_Architecture">and now eBay</a>, 
you see they aren't using traditional relational databases, or if they 
are, they aren't using them in a traditional manner.
This isn't an aberration, nor is it a case of NIH, these
are the artifacts of working at a different scale, and more importantly, you should
expect to see the differences continue to <i>grow</i> as the ratio widens.

At some point in the past rolling out an application to
300,000 people was the pinnacle of engineering excellence. Today
it means you passed your second round of funding and can 
move out of your parents garage.

    What about Amazon? They sure do scale pretty well, I do not know much about their infrastructure and I would like to know if they're using a "traditional" relational database or a BigTable-like approach.

P.S.: please make the "Name" field on this form accept more characters
