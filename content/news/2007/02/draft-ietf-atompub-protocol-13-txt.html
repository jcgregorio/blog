  <p>Draft 13 of the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol is now available</a>. </p>
<p>This drafts adds in the verbage that our Area Director 
Lisa Dusseault wanted added before she would let the 
specification progress to last call. In addition the specification 
now contains James' Atom Format media-type 'type' parameter specification. 
The document references have been updated to be more 
consistent, adding URLs to some, and shortening up some other anchors. Finally the RNC has been cleaned up.
