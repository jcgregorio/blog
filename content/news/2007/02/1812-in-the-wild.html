<p>Wow, color me impressed. Imagine what would happen
if 1812 actually had documentation. I would love to hear about the 
experience.

    I guess this is an 1812 question, so not exactly offtopic:

<blockquote>Why is this entry timestamped 2007-02-04T22:21:27.713835-05:00?  That's about twenty minutes from now...</blockquote>

<p>Is time a leaky abstraction?</p>

<p>I would recommend a shell account at <a href="http://cornerhost.com">cornerhost</a>, which is 
where BitWorking is hosted.</p>

    <p>I will post about the experience in more detail, although it may be a little while. It wasn't exactly easy, but I have pretty much everything with the exception of comments working. I think that may be due to the fact that I'm using Python 2.4 instead of 2.5. I might have a patch or two to contribute, too.</p>
<p>Thanks for the post. It made my morning. ☺</p>
