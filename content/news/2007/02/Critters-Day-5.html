  <p>The <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/critters/">Critter Generator</a> has been online for only five days
and it's already been 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/127/Combinatorial-Critter-Generator-Web-Service#X5">ported to PHP and incorporated 
into a product</a>. w00t!

    <p>I hadn't time to do this, but one thing that seems pretty obvious to me was that the critters can be whipped up entirely in DHTML.  Consider this article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites/">css sprites</a>.  Assume you've got a set of pngs with 8 variations of a feature in each png.  With the sprite technique, you could easily layer the images and 'shift' them to show any one variant.  To preserve state, you could append something like a ?critter=01356 to the end of your URI, and have JS parse the query string. each position in the number represents a feature, and the digit is the variant.

Maybe I'll have time to put it together, but if not, anyone's welcome to this approach...
