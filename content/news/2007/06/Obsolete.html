<blockquote><p>(Note ifconfig, route, mii-tool, nslookup commands are obsolete)</p></blockquote>
<p>I apparently missed a memo.</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    <p>I have a faint recollection of some noise a while back about making <kbd>ip</kbd> (provided by iproute2) <em>the</em> interface to <kbd>ifconfig</kbd> and <kbd>route</kbd>.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, that's just more fodder for the <a href="http://www.steve.org.uk/Reference/rosetta.html">Unix rosetta stone</a> someone has kindly compiled. I also remember how even NT had standard <kbd>route(8)</kbd> syntax. But Leeenux? Can't have that, can we?</p>
<p>I value commonality of basic syntax between my tools above cleverness.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the Unix Rosetta Stone, that's fantastic.</p>

    On my Mac at least, dig seems to be the official successor to nslookup.

    Just becuase they're obsolete doesn't mean they don't still work ok, but you can do much more with their replacements - <tt>ip addr</tt>, <tt>ip route</tt>, <tt>ethtool</tt> and <tt>dig</tt>. For example, you can abbreviate arguments to <tt>ip</tt> (great for those more used to routers), easily add/remove an address (<tt>ip addr add IP dev eth0</tt> vs some ifconfig-fu I was always scared of using in case I took down the network by accident), do source routing, change wake-on-lan options, and see much more useful info when debugging DNS issues.
