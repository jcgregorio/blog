<p>This post hit close to home since I didn't take a compiler class
  as an undergraduate so the summer before I started graduate school
  I bought the Dragon Book, read it, and then wrote a small compiler.</p>
<p> As you can guess, I'm a blast at parties.</p>
<p>Red. I know you were going to ask, and the Dragon Book I used was the red one. 
  There is, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles%2C_Techniques%2C_and_Tools">a wikipedia entry on the dragon books</a>, which explains that
  there's two Dragon Books, the first edition and the second edition, which are 
  referred to respectively as 'red' and 'purple'.

<p>Anyway, that was a formative experience, and in every single job since I've 
created at least one DSL, compiler, interpreter, or parser; and typically more than one.

I keep thinking of a story about hammers and nails :-)

    By an amazing coincidence I have just spent the last hour talking with one of the author of the Dragon books (there's a new one), Ravi Sethi.
