  <p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/197/In-which-we-narrowly-save-Dare-from-inventing-his-own-publishing-protocol#X8">From the comments</a>, Winter has some good questions and observations about the APP.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was surprised to see the Media Collection model as the
preferred approach in some cases and was wondering if I was missing
something.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not preferred, but there is a dividing line. An Atom Entry is a good
representation of a 'document'; it has things like title, author, id, etc.
There are all things you see on every real world document, whether it be
a book, a magazine, a form at the DMV, or a dollar bill. There are many
things for which a mapping into an Entry will be natural, and also note that while
you may edit a document via the APP and the representations are in the form of
Entries, you can offer that resource in a multitude of representations. (Think,
for example, of a calendar entry and all the formats you have to choose from.)
There are, of course, things you can't map <em>into</em> an Entry, and for
those we have the media collection. I think there is a continuum between what
you would put in an Entry versus put in a media collection, and the 'best'
place to draw the dividing line is going to come from some real world
experience.  </p>
<p>When you say "large Media Collections" I think there are two possibilities,
the first of having many members, and the second of having members that are
large.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of the APP had <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-04.html#collection_doc">a very light listing format</a> - 
just a URI and a title. It
was successfully argued that a richer listing format would be better,
allowing clients to construct a view that was appropriate for their particular
user. By using Atom as the listing format you can present
a sorted list of entries based on title,
updated, published, category, etc. If we went with the light format
then you would <em>have</em> to download each entry before presenting a list of
entries to the user. This is also a way of addressing large collections: by 
listing the collection you get a fair amount of meta-data about the members
of the collection without having to GET each individual entry, i.e. the server
gives enough information up front that retrieving each individual entry
is not necessary.</p>
<p>If you still need to retrieve all the members of a large collection, for a collection with 
members that are large, then the cost of setting up 
and tearing down a socket will be negligble compared to the time to retrieve
a single member, so having to do individual requests for members really isn't the
performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>Collections with many members that are small could be expensive if you had to retrieve
   each representation during an <b>initial sync</b> using only the <b>core protocol</b> if you were unable to use 
   <b>keep-alive</b> and <b>pipelining</b>.</p>
<p>I want to highlight some parts of that last sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dt>initial sync</dt>
<dd>If you want to keep a client up to date with a collection, with the addition of
     app:edited and the use of atom:ids it is possible, after initially syncing
     up a client with all the members on a server, to come back later and only
     retrieve the representations of the members that have changed
     since your last sync.</dd>
<dt>keep-alive</dt>
<dd>Much of the overhead of many small requests comes from setting up and tearing down
    sockets, and the use of HTTP 1.1 keep-alive can do much to mitigate that overhead.
  </dd>
<dt>pipelining</dt>
<dd>Current support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining">pipelining</a> is spotty on the web in general, but if an
    effort went into improving the situation for APP then that would 
    also help the web in general and web browsers in particular.
  </dd>
<dt>core protocol</dt>
<dd>There is nothing to give special support to this scenario in the core
   protocol, but there are extension points where this could be added. For example,
   if a common use case was found to be a large number of small member entries and 
   the performance of that scenario needed addressing, a simple extension could be defined for a collections
   that allowed a server to indicate to the client that the entries in the collection feed were
   complete representations.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope you take away several things from this, the first being that we did 
 indeed think of these things - and talk about them - at length - for years.
 The second is that the APP that gets published is the core protocol, a solid base
 on which extensions can and will be built, and that the extensibility of that
 core protocol was also discussed at length. The third is that the APP was designed
 to actually use HTTP, instead of treating it merely as a transport, and that 
 for many of the things you may be used to seeing specified in a protocol we actually
 rely on the mechanisms of HTTP.

    This is great stuff (along with Bill de h√ìra's recent posts), but I can't help noticing the mismatch between your level of expertise and that of certain APP detractors.  You're having a meeting of the minds about pipelining and syncing and the theory of partial updates, and your opponents are saying, "AHA, so you admit it's JUST A THEORY!"
