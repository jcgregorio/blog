<blockquote><p>I actually haven't found a production implementation of APP ...</p></blockquote>
<p>Uhm, yeah, I've been meaning to mention that; <em>there are no production implementations
  of the APP</em>. As a matter of fact, there are no implementations of the APP at all. Period. 
  That's because the spec isn't finalized, and part of that finalization process will be the assignment 
  of a URI for the "app:" namespace, which implies that every single implementation <em>today</em> has
  the wrong namespace for Service and Category documents.

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg09615.html">The new namespace has been minted</a>:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.w3.org/2007/app</code></pre>

    Interesting.  

On another note, any chance you could (lead the way to get others to) start calling it "AtomPP" instead of "APP?"  That's the term some (enlightened?) people are using on [rest-discuss].  If the problem with the term "APP" isn't obvious it's because it's too easily confused with the short form on the word "APPlication."

<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-15.html#terminology">Section 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For convenience, this protocol can be referred to as the "Atom Protocol" or "APP".</p></blockquote>

    No one’s gonna type “Atom Protocol” every time, but “APP” isn’t googlable. I’ll keep saying “AtomPP”, whether or not there’s spec language to back up that usage.

    @Joe: Thanks for the response, but the spec was short-sighted and Aristotle is right.  Probably the best reason to use AtomPP is uniqueness for googling as Aristotle points out...

    Why didn't you guys get the new-style W3C namespace: http://www.w3.org/ns/app?

<p>I have no idea. Just like the Atom Syndication Format namespace URI, it just appeared, I'm not aware of who, when, where, why or how it came into existence.</p>
