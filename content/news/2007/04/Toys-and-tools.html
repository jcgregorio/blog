  <p>My 12 year old just showed me how to 
   install custom brushes in <a href="http://gimp.org/">Gimp</a>.
</p>
<p>Does the product you use when you're 12 influence
  the product you use when you're 22?</p>

    <p>This is the first sign of old age :-)</p>
<p>More seriously, kids are not afraid of computers and technology anymore. My 4-year old daughter and 2-year old son routinely use the computer, satellite TV, DVD player, etc. like most kids of their age.</p>
<p>This is the Web 2.0 generation!</p>

    I think so --- I'm planning to spend most of the next three years looking at how to recycle/adapt the tools that 12-20 year olds find natural (e.g., instant messaging) for use in software engineering.  Partly, I think it's a great opportunity, but partly, it's a defensive move ;-)
