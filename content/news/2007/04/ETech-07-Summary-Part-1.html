  <p>
Ok, so the first thing I learned from ETech is that not only 
can I not live-blog, <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/153/Tidbits-from-ETech07">I can't even blog tidbits through the day</a>.
I had been to ETech last year and presumed that it was just intense
because I was only there for 36 hours, and that there was no way
that that intensity could be sustained for four days.
</p>
<p>
I was wrong.
</p>
  <p>
Before going on  I'd like to take a little tanget and 
talk about my undergraduate education. I ended up in the Honors 
Program at <a href="http://www.easternct.edu/">ECSU</a>, 
which offered team taught interdisciplinary classes.
Those were some of the best classes I ever took, and it was that
intersection of two disciplines that was the key.
</p>
<p>Let me take another aside and say that the honors classes
were the closest thing to what I <i>expected</i> college to
be like. I'll admit to having unrealistic expectations about
college.
</p>
<p>This is all just as a way of setting the context 
  for answering <a href="http://exterior.trevor.smith.name/2007/03/no_areae_announ.html">Trevor Smith's question</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not seeing the frantic, multimodal ETech blog coverage as in past years.
    Has it jumped the shark or am I just unsubscribed?</p></blockquote>
<p>The speaker line-up was a bit scattered, but 
   the sessions that I leaned more toward were the "emerging" 
   and not as much the "technology". It seemed that more of sessions this year were 
   academic in nature, and that was a change that I really liked;
   I spend all day reading blogs and working with technology, I don't
   need to go to a conference to see what will be new to my 
   mother-in-law tomorrow, I want to go to a conference where 
   I see a cross section of disciplines. I want to take a little
   dip back into those interdisciplinary classes, and get
   a look at those rich veins where two disciplines meet.
   Personally I'd like to see the conference take an even stronger
   move in that direction. For example, I'd love to 
   see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> talk.

<p>Standout speakers include:</p>

<dt><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2007/view/e_sess/10739">Matt Webb</a> [<a href="http://interconnected.org/home/">blog</a>]</dt>
<dd>He's one of the guys that created <a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/2006/availabot/">availbot</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2007/view/e_spkr/2657">Jane McGonigal</a> [<a href="http://avantgame.blogspot.com/">blog</a>]</dt>
<dd>She's got the coolest job title in the world: "resident game designer with the Institute for the Future".</dd>
<dt><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2007/view/e_spkr/1731">danah boyd</a> [<a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">blog</a>]</dt>
<dd>If you ever get a chance, do yourself a favor and see dana speak.
    Jane, danah, and <a href="http://www.timaoutloud.org/">Timothy Appnel</a> ran the werewolf games, 
    which I looked forward to all year, ever since I played last year at ETech.

<dt><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2007/view/e_spkr/2912">Jeff Jonas</a> [<a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/">blog</a>]</dt>
<dd>It figures that I'd have to travel to the other side of the country
        to ETech to learn about yet another cool thing happening <i>inside</i> IBM.    
        It's hard to explain to people outside IBM what "330,000 employees" actually means.

<p>I saw a couple patterns emerge from the sessions I attended.
   More on that tomorrow.

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/focus_of_the_ne_1.html">It appears Tim is thinking along these lines for next year</a>.</p>
