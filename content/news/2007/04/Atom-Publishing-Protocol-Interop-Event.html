  <p>There will be an Atom Publishing Protocol Interop Event at Google
April 16th and 17th, <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/April2007Interop">see the wiki for more details</a>. The price of admission is a client and/or server implementation to test against. I'll have both my Python client and server implementations. See you there. 
</p>
<p>Yes, two full days of testing.</p>
<p>Yes, we'll have to figure out what to do Monday evening.</p>
