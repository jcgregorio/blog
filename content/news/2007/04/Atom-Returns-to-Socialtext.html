<blockquote><p>
...so I went off and implemented a good start at Atom support in the REST API.

<p>w00t!</p>
<blockquote><p>Monday and Tuesday there is an APP Interop Event at Google. I wish I had done this work sooner, as I would have liked to show up.
I can make a Socialtext server and service document available, if there is interest.
