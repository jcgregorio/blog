title: First Atom Publishing Protocol Interop Notes

  <p>
So the first Atom Publishing Protocol Interop meeting took
place over the past two days. The event was hosted by Google,
and I'd like to extend a big Thank You to <a href="http://blog.unto.net">DeWitt</a> and the rest of the Googlers for 
hosting this event. The food and facilities were great, though
it appears 20 guests in a single room seemed to tromp the guest wi-fi network.
</p>
  <p>
It was great to meet so many people face to face after all this time.
See <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/16/Interop">
    Tim's post for a good set of pictures</a>, plus write-ups from 
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/04/atom_publishing_protocol_inter.html">Keith Fahlgren</a>,

<a href="http://journals.aol.com/panzerjohn/abstractioneer/entries/2007/04/17/app-interop-final-score/1430">John Panzer</a>.
Hat tip to John, with Sam Ruby not able to make it, he and I were the only
two people from the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Yes__it_is_that_important">original Atom meeting almost four years ago</a>.
</p>
<p>Down to interop. The executive summary: It's all good.</p>
<p>The slightly longer summary:</p>
<p>We had interop a majority of the time.
  The fact that at the very first interop meeting you could pick
  any two implementations at random and have a good chance
  that they'd work together is fantastic.
</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/InteropGrid">interop grid</a>, with checkmarks where
we had interop between a client and a server. Note that there are notes 
in the grid for both successful and unsuccessful pairings.
With 14 serves and 9 clients it just wasn't going to be possible to fill
in all 126 combinations in two days. That fact that we had that many
servers and clients before even getting an RFC number is very encouraging.
</p>
<p>
  While we did have some cases where we didn't achieve interop,
  the best news is that none of the problems was due to an
  ambiguity in the spec.
  </p>
<p>There were several areas that were consistent sticking points.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Authentication</dt>
<dd>There was a much wider variety of authentication schemes
      than most people expected. I'll correct James here and point out
      that the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestclient/">APP Test Client</a> is built on 
     <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a>, which supported all the
      authentication mechanisms there, including WSSE.
       </dd>
<dt>Relative URIs</dt>
<dd>
        My server implementation was considered "evil" by some
        since I used relative URIs everywhere I could. The "evil" was
        all in joking and I have to agree with Tim about the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/17/Interop-Conclusions#p-2">attitude in the room</a>. 
        We had a general discussion about relative URIs and xml:base 
        and everyone who didn't support them went on to add support right there in the room, or to 
        put it on their to-do list.
        </dd>
<dt>Semicolons, who knew?</dt>
<dd>The semicolon I added to my service document URI was not 
      intended in anyway to be "evil", but it caused at least one
      client to fail "spectacularly", to quote that clients author.
      </dd>
<dt>XHTML</dt>
<dd>My APP Test Client can send summary and content
      as XHTML, which caused problems for two servers that I know
      of, with one of them dropping all the markup while
      preserving the text. Back to the attitude, this was 
      logged as a bug, and it will be fixed.
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>In all, the meeting was incredibly useful and productive 
and everyone agreed that we should have these
face to face sessions every six months to a year, and that
we should also have "virtual" interop sessions once a month.
Thankfully DeWitt volunteered to herd those cats.
</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>
This was a question I got alot; "After APP gets
an RFC number, what comes next?"
</p>
<p>Part of the answer is logistical and it was great to have 
<a href="http://nih.blogspot.com/">Lisa Dusseault</a> there to answer those questions. The WG will cease, 
but the mailing list will continue to operate. Extensions
can be brought forward as individual submissions and discussed
on the list before asking the IETF to raise them 
to Informational, Experimental, or Proposed Standard.
As for the future of APP itself I see useful work 
going forward on:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Extensions</dt>
<dd> I think there are a bunch of useful ones
    that could be added, such as a standard way to link from
    an OpenSearch document from a service document. Navigating
    around a small collection via paging is okay, but when you
    get to collections with members in the thousands or 
    millions, search is going to be primary means of navigating
    the collection, and OpenSearch is the drop dead obvious
    way to do that.
    </dd>
<dt>Profiles</dt>
<dd>now there seem to be two schools of thought
    on this, either a profile for a 'workspace', i.e. these
    collections represent a blog, or a more focused profile
    for collections, i.e. this is a blog entry collection,
    this is a collection for links, this is 'trash', etc.
    </dd>
<dt>Relationships</dt>
<dd>
    Also there was a lot of interest in links among collections, i.e.
    entry 'A' has a link to collection 'B', where 'B' is 
    a collection of all the comments on entry 'A'.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>All in all it was a great meeting and I look forward to the next one.</p>
