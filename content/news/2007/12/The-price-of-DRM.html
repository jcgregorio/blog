  <p>I had this conversation with my mother-in-law this weekend just after she finished showing me the <a href="http://www.tivo.com/whatistivo/tivofeatures/homemediafeatures/index.html">Home Media Features of her TiVo</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Would you believe that none of the music I bought from iTunes would work with it? None of it, because of that DRM."</p> <p>"You should buy your MP3s from Amazon."</p> <p>"Oh, I know about that, and I will, I'm never buying another thing from iTunes."</p> </blockquote> <p>Nobody cares about DRM until they have to, and then they care passionately. </p> <p>It may take a while for your customers to figure out that you've shafted them with DRM, but in the end they will, and they're all going to be as mad as my mother-in-law.</p>
