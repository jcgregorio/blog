  <p>Upon closer inspection it appears that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342335011">SimpleDB</a> is <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/GETSful">GETSful</a>.</p>

Indeed.  It's even stranger because they make it look like it's ReSTful.
</p><p>
The front page docs have bits like "GET, PUT or DELETE" in addition to claiming to be a REST interface.  Which all looks fine until you realize that "Amazon SimpleDB REST calls are made using HTTP GET requests" and the URIs look like this:
</p><p>
<code>
https://sdb.amazonaws.com/?Action=PutAttributes
</code>
</p><p>
It's too bad.  I really thought for a minute that they guys building this really Got It.</p>

    Indeed. For those that prefer RESTful, I say take CouchDB and run it on an EC2 cluster.

    Apart from the desire to call a spade a spade and SimpleDB a crowbar in order to promote real standards - does that really matter technically in this case when for the most part intermediaries will be Amazon themselves?
Have I got this correct in that the real benefits of ReST are architecturally between ends affording intermediaries of the likes of proxies? Not just the nice CRUD-like resource interface pattern that gets all the lime-light?

    <p>Craig: intermediaries are far from the only reason to do REST. Roy explicitly took them into account in constructing the style, but accommodation of intermediaries wasnâ€™t the only desirable property that the REST style was designed to induce in systems.</p>
<p>The problem with GETSful interfaces specifically is that GET is supposed to be safe: while the server may (as always) do anything it wants in response to the request, the client bears no responsibility for any of it, be it desired or a catastrophe. For a demonstration of what happens when you ignore this expectation that GET requests never change resource state on the server, just look back at the Google Web Accelerator fiasco.</p>
