  <p>It was a nice surprise to see that Apex, NC came in at 
   14 on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2007/top100/">Money's 
   Top 100 Places to Live</a>.

    Funny to see both Holly Springs and Apex on the list, and not Cary or Raleigh.  But honestly, I'd prefer to see none of these on any lists.  We already know it's a good place to live.  Until we start using impact fees or transfer taxes to help cover infrastructure required by all the new people coming in, problems like poor transportation options and overcrowded schools will only get worse.
