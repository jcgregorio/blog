  <p>There are two rules for any change in technology.
</p>
<p>The first is that there will be a dedicated core, those that
are heavily invested, either monetarily or professionally,
in the status quo, and they will resist any change.
</p>
<p>Take for example Java and XML, two technologies that are both in transition.
</p>
<p>Elliotte Rusty Harold seems to be lashing out
  against any changes in his domains of expertise, 
  first <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/java/voting-for-checked-exceptions/">
  taking those who would add closures to Java to task</a>, 
  and then <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/9520">
  spending quite a bit of time on [rest-discuss] trashing JSON</a>.
</p>
<p>For a study in contrasts compare Elliotte's reaction with  
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/21/What-XML-Means">
  the pragmatic response of Tim Bray</a>.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, the second rule?  
</p>
<p>
Change doesn't care about your investment.

    Yeah, ERH has lost a lot of credibility with his recent rest-discuss tirades, imho.  The terms he's speaking in are so stark, it's almost religious.
