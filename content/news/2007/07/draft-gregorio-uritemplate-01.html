  <p>A new internet-draft of <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI Templates</a> is now available. An HTML version of the specification and diffs from the previous version are also available there.
As usual the discussion is taking place on the W3C URI mailing list. Kudos to 
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/07/28/more_uri_templates">Mark</a> for getting 
this version up and out to the printers.
