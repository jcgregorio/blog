As I've said before</a>, Rails deserves a lot of credit for moving 
the bar for web frameworks, but there's nothing magical there

    Hey Joe, thanks for the link to the Sivers article. I've been trying to articulate something similar in my head for a while.

    PHP on Trax works just like Rails and you have freedom to customize it to do whatever you want!  http://www.phpontrax.com
