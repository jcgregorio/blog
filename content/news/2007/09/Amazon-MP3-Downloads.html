  <p>For the first time in my life I downloaded music off the internet legally.</p>
<p>Let me qualify that statement:</p><p>
<ol>
<li>I've never downloaded music <b>il</b>legally.</li>
<li>I've never used iTunes, or any other DRM-laden "service" to buy music.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>For the first time in my life I can download music off the internet legally
   using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/163856011/ref=topnav_storetab_dm_hp_nav_lk/102-2761028-1746528">Amazon's new MP3 service</a>.</p>
<p> I've been waiting for this day for a long time.</p>
<p>
  While I know that there are plenty of independent music sites out there
  I've never had luck navigating their interfaces or getting good recommendations
  out of them. Besides, what I really want to do is 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twisted-Sister/dp/B000TCYO0Q/ref=sr_f1_4/102-2761028-1746528?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1190830737&amp;sr=101-4">recapture my mis-spent youth</a>
  by creating a playlist that I would have constructed when I was 
  twelve years old. Of course, we didn't have 'playlists' when I was twelve,
  nor 'mp3's, nor the web. What I'm doing is creating my ultimate 
  '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtape">mixtape</a>'.
</p>
<p>Speaking of which, one of the first songs I went looking for
 was Iron Maiden's "Aces High". Now I didn't find the original there
 so I had to settle for a cover, but what I also found was 
<a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_/102-2761028-1746528?initialSearch=1&amp;url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music-track&amp;field-keywords=aces+high&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">
 a bunch of - shall we say "unconventional" - covers</a>, including two albums by
the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QKNSM6/ref=sr_1_artist_9/102-2761028-1746528?ie=UTF8&amp;parent=B000TPL3O8">Vitamin String Quartet</a>, who did an entire album: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TPXN3C/ref=sr_1_album_9/102-2761028-1746528?ie=UTF8&amp;child=B000TPL3O8">Anatomy of Evil: The String Quartet Tribute to Iron Maiden</a>", and appears to have done many such
tribute albums. Oh, and if you're not into string quartets, they also
have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UDKQ4W/ref=sr_1_artist_7/102-2761028-1746528?ie=UTF8&amp;parent=B000UDKVYC">Piano tribute series</a>.
</p>
<p>But I digress, the point is that Amazon, and in turn some record 
  companies, now have money that they never got from me previously.
  I hope Amazon makes buckets of money off this, and I hope the artists 
  do too, but that's not likely, and that's a completely different story.

    I've used iTunes, but I've never paid money, just used vouchers on soda bottles. I am seriously tempted to buy some MP3s now for the first time. I think it's such a no-brainer. I pay less than CDs to get tracks of less quality. Those who are going to pass them on illegally are going to be outweighed by those like you and me that will now buy.

    When I was twelve I was listening to mods and chiptunes. I still have some of my collection. Can't beat cheesy adlib.

    Joe, that last comment is spam, on-topic or not. You probably want to disarm the signature link, at least.
