  <p><a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005461.php">Judge Ann Aiken of the Oregon Federal District Court</a> ruled that two provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), "50 U.S.C. §§ 1804 and 1823, as amended by the Patriot Act, are unconstitutional because they violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution." Her decision is a refreshing reminder
of the power and uniqueness of our constitution, and a hard slap down
to the administration that proposed the legislation and the weak-kneed congress 
that rubber-stamped it. Here are the last six paragraphs of the 44 page judgement. 
Read it and see how out of touch the President, the House,  and the Senate
are with basic constitutional principles.  I can only presume that in today's 
environment the judge will be decried by the administration and neo-cons as an "activist judge" and a "terrorist sympathizer". 
</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally and perhaps most significantly, In re Sealed Case
ignores congressional concern with the appropriate balance
between intelligence gathering and criminal law enforcement. It
is notable that our Founding Fathers anticipated this very
conflict as evidenced by the discussion in the Federalist Papers.
Their concern regarding unrestrained government resulted in the
separation of powers, checks and balances, and ultimately, the
Bill of Rights. Where these important objectives merge, it is
critical that we, as a democratic Nation, pay close attention to
traditional Fourth Amendment principles. The Fourth Amendment
has served this Nation well for 220 years, through many other 
perils. Title III, like the Supreme Court's pronouncements in
Katz and Berger, recognizes that wiretaps are searches requiring
fidelity to the Fourth Amendment.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the constitutionally required interplay between
Executive action, Judicial decision, and Congressional enactment,
has been eliminated by the FISA amendments. Prior to the
amendments, the three branches of government operated with
thoughtful and deliberate checks and balances - a principle upon
which our Nation was founded. These constitutional checks and
balances effectively curtail overzealous executive, legislative,
or judicial activity regardless of the catalyst for
overzealousness. The Constitution contains bedrock principles
that the framers believed essential. Those principles should not
be easily altered by the expediencies of the moment.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, the FISCR holds that the Constitution need not
control the conduct of criminal surveillance in the United
States. In place of the Fourth Amendment, the people are
expected to defer to the Executive Branch and its representation
that it will authorize such surveillance only when appropriate.
The defendant here is asking this court to, in essence, amend the
Bill of Rights, by giving it an interpretation that would deprive
it of any real meaning. This court declines to do so.
</p>
<p>
For over 200 years, this Nation has adhered to the rule of
law - with unparalleled success. A shift to a Nation based on
extra-constitutional authority is prohibited, as well as illadvised.
In this regard, the Supreme Court has cautioned:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The price of lawful public dissent must not be a
  dread of subjection to an unchecked surveillance
  power. Nor must the fear of unauthorized official
  eavesdropping deter vigorous citizen dissent and
  discussion of Government action in private conversation.
  For private dissent, no less than open public
  discourse, is essential to our free society.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Therefore, I conclude that 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804 and 1823, as
amended by the Patriot Act, are unconstitutional because they
violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint for declaratory relief is granted.
