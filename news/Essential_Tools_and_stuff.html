  <p> Essentials are tools that you pick
  up and then ask yourself how you ever lived without.
  I have several of those, including <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/">rsync</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>, and <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a>.</p><p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html">GNU screen</a> is another 
one of those programs that changes you forever. Here is a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935">great introduction to screen on Kuro5hin</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">Zeroconf</a> (Zero Configuration Networking) looks fascinating. From
  the abstract of the <a href="http://files.zeroconf.org/draft-ietf-zeroconf-reqts-12.txt">requirements</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many common TCP/IP protocols such as DHCP [RFC2131], DNS
   [RFC1034][RFC1035], MADCAP [RFC2730], and LDAP [RFC2251] must be
   configured and maintained by an administrative staff.  This is
   unacceptable for emerging networks such as home networks, automobile
   networks, airplane networks, or ad hoc networks at conferences,
   emergency relief stations, and many others.  Such networks may be
   nothing more than two isolated laptop PCs connected via a wireless
   LAN.  For all these networks, an administrative staff will not exist
   and the users of these networks neither have the time nor inclination
   to learn network administration skills.  Instead, these networks need
   protocols that require zero user configuration and administration.
   This document is part of an effort to define such zero configuration
   (zeroconf) protocols.

<p>Digi has introduced their <a href="http://www.digi.com/news/pressreleases/pr20040316.jsp">Wi-ME</a>
module. I love that name. This is a slick little module you can drop on your
printed ciruit board to add 802.11b (Wi-Fi) to your system. It contains
a 32bit ARM with 2MB Flash and 8MB RAM, and talks to your base system via
serial port.</p>
<p>It looks like after much arguing, haggling and deep thought, the Atom 
  community has
  came up with <a href="http://internetalchemy.org/2004/03/theNucleusOfAtom">
  the same basic pieces of information that the 
  Dublin Core people did</a>. So what to do about it? I don't know. </p>
<p>Oh, 3 people give up blogging, <a href="http://www.gorjuss.com/luvly/20040317-blogless.html">film at eleven</a>.
  For some previously here-to-fore unknown definition
  of term 'self-indulgent'.

<p>And finally, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/22/you-blow-me">Mena Trott, a Persian cat and a monocle away from a James Bond villain.</a></p>
