<p>Over a month ago <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/">Paul Ford</a> published a great essay entitled 
<a href="http://www.ftrain.com/google_takes_all.html">How Google beat Amazon and Ebay to the Semantic Web</a>.
After reading it the first time I thought it was a great introduction to the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>,
an idea I had been trying to wrap my head around even since encountering RDF as it is 
baked into <a href="http://www.purl.org/rss/1.0/spec" title="RDF Site Summary">RSS 1.0</a>.
I had seen the light and bought into the promise of the Semantic Web.
</p>
<p>Time passes...</p>

  
<p>With Dave Winer's floating of the idea of <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS 2.0</a> 
discussions ensue about the RDF in RSS 1.0. After spending some time badgering poor Bill Kearney
for a <a href="http://burningbird.net/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=528">concrete benefit 
of having RDF in RSS 1.0</a> and not getting a really
satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay again.
I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. The magic was gone.</p>
<p>Jump back to a month ago, <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> and I were having a discussion about 
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/20.html#how_liberal_is_too_liberal">
news aggregators accepting non-well-formed XML</a>. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-well-formed">
Well-formed</a> is a strictly defined term in the XML specification. It is a series of constraints
a file must pass before it can be considered XML. Failing to meet any of the constraints
means the file is not an XML file. It is the minimum threshhold for XML and an important
measure because it means that the XML file can be loaded into any number of XML tools
or libraries and manipulated programatically.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, any text file can be manipulated programmatically, just load the
file as a string and do search and replace using using regular expressions. The advantage
of XML is that it imposes a structure that you can navigate using XML tools. And if
there are many files of the same format, for example RSS files, then it becomes easy to 
process a great many of these files at one time and extract useful information. 
Just the kind of processing done by <a href="http://gils.utah.gov/rss/">news aggregators</a>.
That's the idea of what I call the "Well-Formed Web", instead of a web of ill-formed and
difficult to decipher HTML pages, the Well-Formed Web is all those HTML pages 
backed up with Well-Formed XML documents in well-known formats.
</p>
<p>It's the simple power of well-formed XML documents and the ability to easily
process them that took the sheen off the Semantic Web for me. Go back and read
<a href="http://www.ftrain.com/google_takes_all.html">Paul Ford's essay</a> again, but 
this time every time you see "RDF" substitute it with "XML" and
every time he mentions "Semantic Web" replace it with "Well-Formed Web". </p>
<p>Go read it. I'll wait... </p>
<p>So what would be <em>really</em> needed to make Paul's vision come true?
Google already indexes XML documents. So we need an XML format for selling items, for example
the following file could be posted to my web site as http://bitworking.org/forsale.xml:</p>
<div class="example">
<code></code><pre>
&lt;forsale&gt;
    &lt;item id="guitar1"&gt;
        &lt;minimumBid currency="dollars"&gt;300&lt;/minimumBid&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Guitar, Electric. Barely used.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;image&gt;http://...jpg&lt;/image&gt;
	&lt;biddingEnds&gt;2002-09-29T22:49:10-04:00:00&lt;/biddingEnds&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    ...
    &lt;item id="amp1"&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/forsale&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>And a format for recording bids, with the following format, could 
be posted on a bidders web-site at http://iwantit.....org/bids.xml:</p>
<div class="example">
<code></code><pre>
&lt;bid&gt;
    &lt;bidder&gt;
        &lt;email&gt;joe@bitw..&lt;/email&gt;
    &lt;/bidder&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;reference&gt;http://bitworking.org/forsale.xml#guitar1&lt;/reference&gt;
        &lt;offered currency="dollars"&gt;350&lt;/offered&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/bid&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the bidder could have found the 'forsale' file by searching google, but how is he going
to notify the seller that he's posted a bid for it? By using referer logs. That is, the application
that creates and posts these XML files (you didn't expect to do this by hand did you?), can 
also request the 'forsale' file from the sellers site and when it does it fills in the 
referer information with a URL that points back to the bidders 'bid' file. Now the sellers software
can do what <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/20.html#automatic_linkbacks">Mark Pilgrim's 
Automatic linkback</a> software does and collect referer log entries every hour and update
the 'forsale' document to list the highest bids:</p>
<div class="example">
<code></code><pre>
&lt;forsale&gt;
    &lt;item id="guitar1"&gt;
        &lt;minimumBid currency="dollars"&gt;300&lt;/minimumBid&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Guitar, Electric. Barely used.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;image&gt;http://...jpg&lt;/image&gt;
	&lt;biddingEnds&gt;2002-09-29T22:49:10-04:00:00&lt;/biddingEnds&gt;
	&lt;highestBid&gt;http://iwantit.....org/bids.xml&lt;/highestBid&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    ...
    &lt;item id="amp1"&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;

&lt;/forsale&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Sure, not everbody has a web-site to post 'bid's or 'forsale's, so web-hosting
services can do "micro-hosting". For $5 a year they'll give you one of these
selling/bidding apps to run from home and a miniscule amount of file space to posting your files.
The bigger and more frequently updated sites get searched by google more frequently and a whole
new service category springs to life. 
</p>
<p>Distributed eBay. Now that's a web service. Very 
<a href="http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage">RESTian</a>. 
No RDF. Hmmm, anybody got some angel money for me to implement this...:)</p>
<p>This is just one example of the possibilities of the Well-Formed Web. It can
be built today with current tools and with no need for RDF, 3-tuples or ontologies.</p>
