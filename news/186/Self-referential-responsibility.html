  <p>My wife is starting a business, something I will blog more about in the future.
The important part, for this story, is that all the web based things fell to me, and 
I turned to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a>. The startup process was amazing, in just two hours 
we went from zero to having our own domain name, a web site, email, chat,
docs, and calendaring. There's just two employees in the business today, but
we can add up to 200, and all for no costs beyond the $10 for the domain name
registration.
</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the things Lynne wanted was a registration form. I wanted
to keep things simple and keep as much data in Google Apps as possible, so
what I came up with was the idea of creating a registration form that 
appended the data into a Google Spreadsheet. Lynne was thrilled with the idea.
</p>
<p>
Now Google Page Creator doesn't have the ability to create forms using the 
GUI tools so I had to hand code one. Also, there is no gateway for moving
form data into a spreadsheet, so I decided to write a little 
Python CGI script on bitworking.org that would take the output of the form, append it as a 
new row in the spreadsheet, and then redirect back to a page on the
website.
</p>
<p>So, for the record we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/">A Python script</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/u/joe.gregorio/">using the gdata-python-client</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">which uses the Atom Publishing Protocol</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Document_Centric">to add data to a spreadsheet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As I'm coding this up it dawns on me:</p><p>
<blockquote><p>If I can't get this to work, I have no one to blame but myself!</p></blockquote></p>

    I must have been asleep for the past few months because I never realized that it was already possible to automate the editing of Google Spreadsheets.  And via Python!  Very slick.  The cost of creating a small business just keeps getting lower and lower.
