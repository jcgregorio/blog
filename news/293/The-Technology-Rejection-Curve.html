  <p>It now appears that SOA has entered that final phase of the technology rejection curve, the search for the guilty. From earlier this year is looked like it might have been those <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/04/wsec_report#Historical2">long haired RESTafarians fault</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>However, the road to paradise has also been littered with the Web/REST vs. Web Services battles</p></blockquote> <p>But now it appears that it's all because <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/realworldsoa/archives/2008/02/ibm_agrees_with.html">"good" SOA people are hard to find</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class="artText">I've been screaming about this for a few years now, and so has ZapThink. Now the data points are coming in that the lack of SOA talent is killing SOA. Indeed, the larger issue is that the wrong people are working SOA projects, and thus are being setup for failure (see below).</span></p></blockquote> <p>There just has to be a reason for the failure, and it couldn't possibly be the technology. This is what I call the "Scooby-Doo" phase of the technology rejection curve, where the rubber mask has been ripped off and the crook yells as he's dragged off by the cops:</p> <blockquote> <p>And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.</p></blockquote>

    Good timing! I just listened to a <a href="http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/quirks_20080119_4485.mp3">podcast 'article'</a> about cognitive dissonance and 'why humans rationalize bad decisions and errors' on CBC's Quirks and Quarks. We're not the rational animal, but rather the rationalizing.
