  <p>I've always disliked Hungarian Notation, at least the kind that I originally learned, which mandated putting type specifiers at the beginning of each variable name. Now <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html">Joel explains</a> the difference between Hugarian Apps Notation and Hungarian System Notation, and why one is good and the other bad. The source of the divergence comes from misunderstanding the use of the word 'type' in a paper by Charles Simonyi.</p>
<p>This misinterpretation of Hungarian Notation as it moved from the Apps group to the rest of Microsoft and then beyond reminds 
  me of the origins of the 
  <a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/news/2002_h2/08aug2002_water.shtml">"Drink at Least 8 Glasses of Water a Day"</a> myth.
  In this case, it wasn't a missed word, but a missed sentence.
</p>
<p>It would appear that <i>all</i> the words are important.</p>
