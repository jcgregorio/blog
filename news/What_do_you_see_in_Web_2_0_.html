  <p>There is an ongoing discussion on the validity of the "Web 2.0" moniker, started by
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/04/Web-2.0">Tim Bray</a>, 
    rejoined by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/not_20.html">Tim O'Reilly</a>, and 
    refined by <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/08/Agile-Web-2-0-Development">Sam Ruby</a> and 
       <a href="http://technorati.com/search/radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/not_20.html">many others</a>. The whole
   discussion is fascinating not only for technical points, but for the psychological
   aspects. There is no hard and fast definition of "Web 2.0" and the nature
   of that nebulous concept allows it act like a technologist's roschach test. 
</p> 
  
<h3>It's like a rorschach test</h3>
<p>It's like a rorschach test, which let's everyone pour their own 
   thoughts and ideas into it, forming it to how they see the world.
   What shouldn't be suprising is that I see the world diffently
   from most people. To get some perspective let's look at Sam's 
   categorization of the three phases of the web to date:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Web[0] is exemplified by static home pages, published in broadcast mode.  Many weblogs today continue to operate in this fashion.
    </li>
<li>
    Web[1] is exemplified by e-commerce shopping carts, enabling two way interaction between business and consumers.  Comments and Trackbacks are in this category.
    </li>
<li>
    Web[2] is characterized by action-at-a-distance interactions and ad hoc integration.  By my putting a link here, your page rank is changed there.  A book I purchase today affects Amazon's recommendations tomorrow.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>The One-Way Web</h3>
<p>My view differs slightly. At first there was a 
  mostly one-way web. If the communication was two-way it 
  was strictly between one client and one server.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of Web[0]. The only interaction 
is through web forms. This is useful for dropping 
comments on a site, or buying a book.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>The One and a Half-Way Web</h3>
<p>The next stage is more interactive, with trackbacks, pingback, and 
personal publishing. This diagram is also missing
an arrow, one that goes from Server1 to a news aggregator. That
arrow represents RSS and syndication.</p>
<p>Note that all the arrows represent different formats and sometimes
even different protocols. Web pages are server over HTTP, but may
be uploaded to a server via FTP. Feeds are one of the 
many flavors of RSS. The publishing method
could just as well have been WebDAV or the Blogger API.
Each part of the infrastructure is different. It's like living
in an old house where the plumbing is a mix of copper, steel
and PVC -- every transition requires a custom fitting.
</p>

</p>
<h3>The Two-Way Web</h3>
<p>This is where we're headed.</p>
<p>With the rise of Atom we can start to 
   standardize some of that plumbing. Publication can take place
   via the Atom Publishing Protocol, which is just a way of pushing
   Atom Entries up to a server. In turn those Entries can be published as an Atom
   Feed. Trackbacks? Those are just Atom Entries pushed over HTTP too.
   Same thing for comments.
   Now we've got Atom Entries traveling
   from client to the server, from server to the client, even from 
   server to server. It's an entire Atom Entry eco-system. 
   </p>
<p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/2005/8/web2.png" />
</p>
<p>
   But with a standard publication mechanism like the Atom Publishing Protocol
   you can be sure more than just blog entries are going to published.
   For example, look at the early implementations of the TypePad Atom API,
   there's publication points for music, books, and people. You can also be
   sure that blogging clients will be built into many places, the most 
   obvious is the browser itself. It's perfectly reasonable to build
   an APP client in JavaScript that runs inside a Greasemonkey script.
   </p>
<h3>When blogging isn't blogging any more.</h3>
<p>A Greasemonkey script that can publish Atom Entries.</p>
<p>Now we're talking 
real power. How about a script that blogs books to your book blog
everytime you visit Amazon? Or how about one that finds links to FOAF
files on web pages your browsing and then blogs that information to your people blog?
How about mining microformat information, a Greasemonkey script could find 
all the hCalendar information in all the web pages you visit,
or cull them from entries on Bloglines, and publish
them to your calendar blog. The possibilities are endless.
</p>
<p>How do you know a technology has matured? When it becomes invisible. Look at
all the blogging that's taking place in the above scenarios. Look at how 
much of it could be automatic, easy, almost invisible.
</p>
<h3>Stigmergy</h3>
<p>Now let's loop back to something I wrote two and a half years ago, 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Stigmergy">Stigmergy and the World-Wide Web</a>.
    Stigmergy, a term coined by French biologist Pierre-Paul Grasse is 'interaction through the environment'.
    In that essay I outlined all the ways in which the web acted like a
    stigmeric communication system for people. In the Atom Powered Web 2.0, 
    that vision doesn't change, the same principles apply, it's just that with 
    standard plumbing the trails are laid down even faster.
    </p>
<p>If you think I'm pushing the envelope with what can be done with Atom and the APP
   I'll again point to Adam Bosworth's <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail571.html"> 
  "Database Requirements in the Age of Scalable Services"</a> [via 
  <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/25/web-thinking/">lesscode.org</a>].

    <p>Heh, I love the rorschach test angle (hey, I see two monkeys screwing). </p>
<p>The two-way-web is what TimBL described way back, read-only browser implementation put the damper on that.</p>
<p> In fact I really don't think there's much envelope pushing - virtually everything's in place for multi-way Web comms. A key part is the transition from seeing the Web as a document repository to being a database. Bosworth's half-way there, but there are various gaps (my <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/07/31/bosworths-web-of-data/">interpretation</a>).</p>
