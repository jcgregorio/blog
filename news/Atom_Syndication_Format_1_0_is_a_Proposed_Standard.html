<p>So what does Proposed Standard mean?</p>
<blockquote><p>
 A Proposed Standard specification is generally stable, has resolved
   known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received
   significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community
   interest to be considered valuable.  However, further experience
   might result in a change or even retraction of the specification
   before it advances.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it also means that it will get an RFC number. Woot!</p>
<p>The next stop is "Draft Standard". If you want to know all
   the gory details they're all detailed in, you guessed it, an 
   <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2026.txt">RFC</a>.
   At the very least, you have to give the IETF credit for consistency.
