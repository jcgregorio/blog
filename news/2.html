  <p>Taking up <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/08.html#small_world">Mark's request</a> for small world stories.</p>
<p>My wife Lynne and I both graduated from <a href="http://www.ecsu.ctstateu.edu/">Eastern Connecticut State University</a>. While
as an undergraduate I was good friends with Dee Sweet who had the strange title of co-president of
the Biology club. Co-president. Who the hell has co-presidents! Anyway I never met the co-president, only saw him through
a door way one day when he dropped off some papers at Dee's apartment. His name, which I learned later, was Ken. That 
was our first non-meeting.</p>
<p>After graduation Ken moves to Stafford with his family. I grew up in Stafford. My whole family still lives there.</p>
<p>Later Ken moves to Niantic, CT. Into the Giant Neck Heights
sub-division. Five houses down the street from my Father-In-Law. They
waved to each other on my Father-In-Law nightly walks.</p>
<p>Later we move into a new house in a sub-division in Apex, NC. Two
houses down the street from Ken and his family who had moved there the
year before.</p>
<p>At this point in the story we still don't know any of this.</p>
<p>My Father-In-Law is visiting and has driven his van. We are all 
outside watching the kids play in the street. Ken and his wife are
out for a walk. As they walk by my Father-In-Law's van Ken points to a
small green sticker on the bumper of the car, "GNH". </p>
<p>"What does that stand for?", he asks jokingly, "Giant Neck Heights?"</p>
<p>And from there we spent an hour unraveling the trail backwards.</p>
<p>I also have another smaller small world story. Does that make it a micro world story? Anyway...
I was hired at my last job on the same exact day as Matt. Matt turns out to be the son
of one of my wife's grade school teachers.</p>
