  <p>I really need a link blog. Besides, all the cool kids are doing it.</p>

<p>I am now the number one result for the google search 
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=naked%20operating%20table%20valium">naked operating table valium</a>. 
  The only reason I know this is because I found it in my referer logs. Which means
  someone out there typed that into google and ended up at my site. I sure
  hope they found what they were looking for.</p>

    <a href="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a> is great for linkblogging. You can subscribe to other people's links and get an aggregate RSS feed. And there are some tools for displaying your links as a sidebar on your blog.

    Yes.  You want del.icio.us.  It's what I use, and it has a hot URL-based (but not quite REST) API for retrieving your posted links.  It's what feeds my nightly link entries, in case you didn't already know.

    There's also furl.net.<br />
A little less hacker-friendly than del.ic.ious, but supports comments and storing images of the 'logged' page on their server, as well as just a link.
