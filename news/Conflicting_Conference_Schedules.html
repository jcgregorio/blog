  <p>ApacheCon 2004 has released it's <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2004/US/index.html">Call for Participation</a>. 
Unfortunately the timing of ApacheCon 2004 is Nov 14-17 which conflicts with <a href="http://www.xmlconference.org/xmlusa/2004/schedule.html">XML 2004</a> which runs from 
Nov 15-19. I've already gone to ApacheCon once and it was a blast. This year
I am taking a decidedely east coast bias in my travel and I'll be attending XML 2004, which 
is hosted in Washington, DC. It also appears that the 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/meetings/0mtg-sites.txt">61st IETF meeting is being held
in Washington, DC Nov 7-12</a>. Looks like it's going to be a busy month.</p>
