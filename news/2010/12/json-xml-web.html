      It's "Yay", because for important use cases JSON is dramatically better
      than XML.  In particular, JSON shines as a programming
      language-independent representation of typical programming language data
      structures.  This is an incredibly important use case and it would be
      hard to overstate how appallingly bad XML is for this. The fundamental
      problem is the mismatch between programming language data structures and
      the XML element/attribute data model of elements. This leaves the
      developer with three choices, all unappetising: </p>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li> live with an inconvenient element/attribute representation of the data;
        </li><li> descend into XML Schema hell in the company of your favourite data binding tool;
        </li><li> write reams of code to convert the XML into a convenient data structure.
      </li></ul>

   <p><a href=http://bitworking.org/news/425/atompub-is-a-failure>I came to
     that same conclusion a while ago</a>:</p> 
   <blockquote>
     <p>
     The last motivation was for a common interchange format. The idea was that
     with a common format you could build up libraries and make it easy to move
     information around. The 'problem' in this case is that a better format
     came along in the interim: JSON. JSON, born of Javascript, born of the
     browser, is the perfect 'data' interchange format, and here I am
     distinguishing between 'data' interchange and 'document' interchange. If
     all you want to do is get data from point A to B then JSON is a much
     easier format to generate and consume as it maps directly into data
     structures, as opposed to a document oriented format like Atom, which has
     to be mapped manually into data structures and that mapping will be
     different from library to library.  
     </p>

   <p>There are still plenty of use cases for 'documents' of XML, but APIs 
   on the web is not one of them.
