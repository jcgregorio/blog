      <a href=http://bitworking.org/news/2009/09/2TB>A while back I asked</a> for
      suggestions on how to use 4 500GB drives to build a backup machine.
      It took me a while, but two weeks ago I started to build up that
      system, and the first thing I discovered was that the drives were
      SATA but the old Dell box wasn't. 
      I started to hunt around for a SATA box I could buy when it
      dawned on me that I was building a centralized backup system
      for the house. <b>Centralized.</b> As in a single point of failure.
      Which, when you put it that way, didn't sound like such a bright
      idea. So instead I opted for a distributed system; I ordered some 
      USB enclosures, now each machine has it's own independent 500GB 
      backup drive attached. The upside, besides being cheaper and easier
      to implement, is that offsite storage is also going to be a lot easier
      now.
