  <p>Part of the past weekend was spent refurbishing my grill. It's over three
years old and the southern humidity has taken it's toll
on the wood.</p>

<p>So off came the rotting old wood, and on with some new,
  including some improvements, including a bar for hanging
  the tongs and more working space.</p>

    I sure hope my wife doesn't see this.  Every year I tell her that I don't need to clean up the rust on the grill; it adds flavor to the meat.
