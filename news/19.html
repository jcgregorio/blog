  <p>Ken has posted some of his <a href="http://ken.coar.org/blog/index?entry=89">thoughts</a>
on releasing software:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, when it comes to releasing something of 
    my own creation into the wild.. I find I'm hesitant, and reluctant, 
    and otherwise disinclined.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is just one small quote of a much larger
post that must be read in it's entirety but
I have to say it does strike a cord with me.
Putting Aggie up on SourceForge was fun but
also caused me considerable congnitive dissonance. 
I <strong>know</strong> it's good to get other
people looking at and modifying the source. I <strong>know</strong>
that their additions and modifications were
making Aggie better. On the other hand letting
people have access to CVS and let them fiddle with
<strong>my</strong> code was initially tough to 
swallow. Ownership, 100% total control, the ability
to state that I wrote every line of code in the software 
was something I had to give up when other developers started working
on Aggie. It wasn't easy giving up control but I'm glad 
I did it. Today I'm over that and don't have
those feelings anymore, but it definitely took time
for me to personally work through that transition.</p>
