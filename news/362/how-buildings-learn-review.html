Just finished "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Happens-Theyre/dp/0140139966">How Buildings Learn</a>" by Stewart Brand 
and I very much enjoyed it - a good read not because
he gives any pat answers or solutions, but because he refuses to
do so, outlining the problems, pointing at the apparent contradictions,
and in the process exposing vast vistas in how we build
and live in buildings that have yet to be explored or 
investigated. The Appendix is just a summary of all the questions
raised in the book and it's ten pages long.
</p>
<p>
The book introduces a vocabulary, the six 
S's, (Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff), 
which make up the components of a building and have different rates of change.
That in itself made the book useful as I went back myself and
looked at all the renovations and additions we've made to our house
in that context and it was enlightening.
</p>
<p> 
  The book is actually a pretty stinging indictment of most architects
  and architecture schools, as most of the focus is on the look of a building -
  on how well it photographs - and not on how well it works. It's actually
  shocking to learn how infrequently an architect will go back and talk to 
  the people living or working in a building to see how well it is working.
  One of the few architects that is praised,
  and frequently quoted, is Christopher Alexander. I own several of the
  "yellow books" and I'm quite a fan, so it's not much of a surprise that
   I liked this book also.
</p>
<p>
My only wish is that the book was done in color, fully realizing that 
many of the comparison shots wouldn't work very well since the 
first of the pair was usually 50 or 75 years in the past, I'd still like
to have seen contemporary color shots of many of the sites discussed.

    FYI, there was a TV adaptation of the book that is <a href="http://www.truefilms.com/archives/2008/08/how_buildings_l.php">available on Google Video</a>.

    Here are some interesting quotes from "How Buildings Learn" that I found also relevant to software design:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/BillHiggins?entry=alexander_on_design_via_brand">Alexander on abstract vs. concrete</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/BillHiggins?entry=brand_on_evolutionary_design">Brand on evolutionary design</a></li>
</ul>
