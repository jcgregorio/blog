  <p>My latest column, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/06/08/restful.html">Just Use Media Types?</a>, has just been published on <a href="http://www.xml.com">XML.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Wow. Great article Joe. The code and narrative are both very useful.</p>
<p>Here it is on del.icio.us:<br />

I would have posted this on the XML.com page itself but they make you sign up.</p>
<p>Another point: it's a good thing that you link to your xml.com articles from your blog, because I check your blog's feed more often than I do the xml.com one. Also, its easier to comment here.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
