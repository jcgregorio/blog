  <p>Even thought it was a steamy 90 degrees out today
  we spent some time this afternoon fishing at the local
  park.</p>
  <p>We had great success, with everyone catching at least two fish. This 
  was their first time having success at this park, and it was Reilly's
  first fish ever. Every fish caught was photographed before being released
  back to the pond.</p>
<p>Christopher was the first to land a fish. <img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/Fishing_21Jul2003/Christopher.jpg" alt="Christopher with a small bass in his hand." /></p>
<p>Austin was the second one to catch a fish. By now we had discovered that the fish were feeding very close to shore.<img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/Fishing_21Jul2003/Austin.jpg" alt="Austin with a small sunfish at the end of the line." /> They were a little disappointed that they were too small and couldn't bring them home to cook them up.</p>
<p>Lynne arrived towards the end of the fishing trip and got to see Reilly catch his third fish of the day. <img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/Fishing_21Jul2003/Reilly.jpg" alt="Reilly showing off his catch to Christopher and Mom." /></p>
