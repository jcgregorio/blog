  <p>I have moved the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a> project off
  of SourceForge and onto Google Project Hosting. There are a lot of reasons for the move.
  First is just the scale of the project; <code>httplib2</code> isn't
a big project and SourceForge just has way too many knobs; it presents
a very large dashboard for such a small project.
Also as <code>httplib2</code> becomes more stable the majority
of the work will shift into documentation and that will be
made easier by the wiki. Third is the integration points:
I have wanted to create a mailing list for checkins but
have put it off under SourceForge knowing what a pain it can be.
Creating just such a mailing list/google group under
code.google.com is trivial in comparison. And finally, the
speed of the web interface for code.google.com is
substantially faster than SourceForge.
</p>
<p>
All in all it is going to make managing the project much
faster and easier with no loss in functionality.

    I, for one, am glad to see this move. Google's hosting just seems much more simple than SF.  It's very fitting for a Python project.

    any chance httplib2 will end up in Python's standard lib?
I find it to be much better than httplib.

Also, nice choice on moving to Google.  Their services are minimal and simple.. exactly as they should be.
