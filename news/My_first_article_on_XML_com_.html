  <p>My first article, <a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2004/02/03/atom8.html">Atom API Update</a>, is now up 
   on <a href="http://webservices.xml.com">XML.com</a>. It provides an overview of the changes in the 
   latest version of the draft RFC and lays the groundwork for future aticles that will explore how the
   AtomAPI enables the Editable Web.</p>

    Congratulations. It's really a good article. I can't hope to see next articles talking about wikis or comments.

    Excellent article.  Looking forward to more on Atom.

One note: there are a few typos/inconsistences in the printed article in the URLs/code fragments.

Thanks!
