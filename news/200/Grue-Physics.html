<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=314874">Brian Beckman: The Physics in Games - Real-Time Simulation Explained</a> is a channel 9 video that I found via jon Udell. The meat of the interview comes at about an hour into the interview when Brian starts to talk about Sticks and Stones physics as opposed to how game physics is typically done today.  
<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/06/13/airplanes-cars-sticks-and-stones-brian-beckman-on-the-physics-of-simulation/">Jon Udell observes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve heard it before, we’ll hear it again: a network of many simple parts trumps one big complex monolith. It’s a story that keeps on surprising us, but probably shouldn’t.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That observation is a great introduction to philospher Nelson Goodman's riddle about 
induction and the color <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_%28color%29">Grue</a>
[ via <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/06/15/ol-li">Mark</a> ].
There are patterns that are strongly wired into our brains, patterns where we look
for monolithic solutions instead of many simpler parts interacting using 
simple rules. Breaking from that monolithic mindset is always controversial. You 
need only look at the contemporary reactions surrounding the advent of 
evolution and the invisible hand of Adam Smith to see what I mean.
