  <p>My <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/07/13/secure-rss.html">Secure Syndication</a> article 
   and <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/securesyndication/">greasemonkey script</a> has now
   been up for a week. It's received <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/06203d2de4fd4fb5b62776a20fa3cdac">a lot</a> of <a href="http://technorati.com/search/www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/07/13/secure-rss.html">attention</a> and I'd like to clear up <a href="http://bcm.maz.org/archives/000167.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.volubis.com/blog/archives/001004.html">of the</a>
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/07/16/feed_history">misunderstandings</a> I've seen.</p>
<dl>
<dt>This is just for RSS.</dt>
<dd>Not true. While I concentrated on RSS in the article this will work just 
     fine for Atom, or for that matter, as I point out in the article, any old web page.
     It doesn't even need to be syndicated.
   </dd>
<dt>Atom has it's own mechanism</dt>
<dd>Not true. This one is my own fault. If you read the article
     you get the impression that Atom has the same capabilites, but just delivered
     using XML Encryption. That is not the case. The Atom Format specification only 
     defines how to apply XML Encryption to the whole feed document, which would
     require the <em>aggregator</em> to be able to decrypt the feed, and that 
     was the situation we wanted to avoid. There is nothing in the Atom specification
     that specifies how to encrypt just part of the 'content'. 
   </dd>
<dt>Greasemonkey has bugs so the whole idea is wrong.</dt>
<dd>Yes, bugs have been found in Greasemonkey, and it appears that 
      <a href="http://www.mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/003999.html">some of the impetus</a> 
      came from people looking at how secure Secure Syndication was. I very much appreciate the effort
      that has gone into that review, and I am glad that those issues 
      have been found and are being resolved, but none of the problems found
      <b>so far</b> have been flaws in the basic premise, but instead are 
      bugs in Greasemonkey. Which leads to the next misconception.
   </dd>
<dt>This is only for FireFox/Greasemonkey</dt>
<dd>Not at all. Opera now supports user scripting and I have found
     at least three different projects to bring user scripting to IE.
     The JavaScript used is very basic and should be able to be ported 
     to all those enviroments. I used Greasemonkey because it was the fastest way to get this 
     system up and running. I could have just as easily created a FireFox extension to 
     do the same thing, it just would have taken me longer.

  Does the compiled FireFox extension have the same vulnerabilities that Greasemonkey has?

    <p>I checked around a bit, and the short answer is no, the compiled extension does not have the same vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The whole problem is with the <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/api/">Greasemonkey api</a>, more specifically with GM_xmlhttpRequest. But the compiled extension does not include the api, so any script that uses it will not work. </p>
<p>The current version of Greasemonkey (0.3.5) also disables all the api funcions as a security measure.</p>

    A new version of Greasemonkey is coming VERY SOON that restores the API functions and fixes the security vulnerabilities.  (No, you can't have it.)
