  <p>Windows Live Writer is now available as a <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview">free download</a>. Notable because it has support for the Atom Publishing Protocol. Even more notable is that this entry was created with Live Writer. My hand written blogging software that exports a generic AtomPub interface works with Live Writer right out of the box. Kudos to <a href="http://jcheng.wordpress.com/2007/11/06/finally-final/">Joe Cheng</a> and the rest of the Live Writer team.</p>

And there you have it.  That alone a huge tribute to the value of the protocol, without even touching the deeper capabilities that it offers.

    You might have said it's Windows only Joe?

    Dave,
<p>Sorry, since it's from Microsoft I thought that went without saying.
