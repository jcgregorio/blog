  <p>Shortly after I started my first job they sent me on a trip to Austria.
This is my first real international trip, the senior trip to France doesn't really
count as international travel. I arrive at the hotel around 4pm very jetlagged 
and proceed to crash in the hotel room, which is a mistake.</p>
<p>
I wake up panicked to find my watch says 7. I know my ride to the Salzberg office arrives at 8.
I have no idea where the main office is so I cannot miss this ride, and 
I also want to make a good first impression for the folks at the parent company.
</p>
<p>
I take a quick bath (there were no showers, only bath tubs) and charge downstairs to get 
breakfast. When I checked in they promised a breakfast buffet from 6 to 9, but when
I get down there it's not setup.</p>
<p> In fact, no one is down there.</p>
<p>Eventually I find some of the staff in the back of 
the kitchen. </p>
  
<p>"The breakfast buffet, I thougt it was from 6 to 9?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It is."</p>
<p>Glancing behind me to adeptly show off my keen powers of observation, "But it's not setup."</p>
<p>"From 6 to 9 <b>AM</b>." And they start giggling at me, standing there, 
  all bathed and freshly dressed ready to start my day at 8pm.</p>
<p> That same giggling I had to face every day 
for the rest of the week. Every time I 
left or arrived at the hotel the staff in the know pointed me out 
to the staff not in the know and 
the giggling would start all over again.</p>
