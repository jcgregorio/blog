  <p>My latest article <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/07/13/secure-rss.html">Secure RSS Syndication</a>, is up on XML.com.
   In this article I present a Greasemonkey script to make FireFox decrypt a Blowfish-encrypted feed shown in Bloglines on the fly.
   And the encrypted data, it's held in a microformat.</p>
<p>We're playing buzzword bingo.</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/securesyndication/">Source code and test feed</a> are available.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> This project explains my 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Microformats_and_Syndication">interest in which web-based aggregators
   preserve microformats</a>.</p>

    <p>Ha!  I have a Greasemonkey book that explains how to add a Textile parser to textareas.  The book was written by one person, who explained how the script was written by a second person, then improved by a third person by integrating code written by a fourth person, who based his code on the work of a fifth person, who in turn based his code on the work of a sixth person.</p>
<p>I don't win anything, but I really enjoyed saying all that.</p>
<p>PS - The second person was Roberto.  (Hey Roberto!)  The first and fifth persons were me.</p>
<p>Dean wrote Textile in PHP.  I ported it to Python as PyTextile.  Jeff ported PyTextile to Javascript as JsTextile.  Roberto wrote a "Textile It!" Greasemonkey script that hit a CGI script that called PyTextile.  Phil integrated Roberto's Greasemonkey script with Jeff's JsTextile library to create a purely client-side version.  I wrote up Phil's script and the entire backstory in "Greasemonkey Hacks".  (In stores in November!  Pirate it now and avoid the rush!)</p>
<p>PPS - Hey Joe, want to cut that article down to 500 words and get published in an O'Reilly book?</p>

  Ok, I win at buzzword bingo, but you just won at buzzword pachinko.</p>
<p>  Sure, I'd love to trim that article down and get it published in an O'Reilly book.</p>
