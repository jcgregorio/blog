  <p>I am shocked, just shocked, to find out that the main stream media
 is falling down on the job of covering the 2008 election. From
 the <a href="http://www.journalism.org/node/8187">Project for Excellence in Journalism</a>
 [via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/were-doomed/">
Krugman</a>] :</p>
<blockquote><p>In the early months of the 2008 presidential campaign, the media had already winnowed the race to mostly five candidates and offered Americans relatively little information about their records or what they would do if elected, according to a comprehensive new study of the election coverage across the media.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My executive summary: Journalists are lazy and biased. It is of little 
  solace that they are more lazy than biased. Read the whole article for all the 
  depressing details.
