  <p>I have been thinking about rewriting my blogging software for 
years now. I've even rewritten the underlying data
store. More than once. Literally, written two fully working
implementations before this one and threw them both
away. Looks like the third time's a charm.
</p>

  
<p>
Some features include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Converts all incoming summary and content into well-formed XHTML.
  Most of that was accomplised by borrowing code from Venus.
</li>
<li>That allows me to generate an Atom feed that 
  has summary and content elements of type="xhtml".
  </li>
<li>Also handles incoming unicode correctly and converts named and numeric entites 
  into their associated unicode code points. Ala &amp;plusmn; gets turned into ±, and 
  &amp;#x2604; gets turned into ☄.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Still to work on 
is the APP implementation (client and server),
handling of drafts, and comments.
Yes, comments will be returning to BitWorking, but
not too soon, and they will probably be tied
to OpenID, so get your account now.
