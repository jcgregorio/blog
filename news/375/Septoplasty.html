  <p>I have been absent for the majority of the past three weeks due to 
various family medical issues. Everyone is OK now and I'm back to work.
Part of the time I was out was because I had surgery, a septoplasty
and turbinate reduction. Let me tell you about that surgery.
</p>
<p>Oh, if you are squeamish you should stop reading now.</p>
<p>Really, just stop now. </p>
<p>You've been warned.</p>
<p>Septoplasty is surgery to go in and
straighten out or repair the septum, the piece of cartilage that
runs down the middle of the nose. It appears that early in my life
my septum slid off to one side of the bone it's supposed to be resting on. I didn't think
cartilage was afforded that kind of mobility, but apparently mine was.
My doctor later explained with a disturbing amount of glee that the 
cartilage was "pretty messed up in there".
</p>
<p>If I wasn't born with a deviated septum then it deviated when I was very young, as 
I've had some trouble breathing through my nose as long as I can remember, and had no idea
what 'normal' breathing was like. I would frequently hear
people with colds complain that they couldn't sleep because their
nose was stuffed up and they could only breath through their mouth.
I always found that kind of baffling as I never breathed through my nose while
I slept, I simply didn't have enough air flow. Breathing through my nose 
as I slept was as plausible as breathing through my ears.
</p>
<p>Anyway, as I've gotten older the situation has gotten worse
and I finally decided to get it fixed, and two Mondays ago 
I went in for surgery. Now, I was told to expect one full week to
recover and ..., well, let's look at what <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/repair-of-a-deviated-septum-septoplasty-what-to-expect-after-surgery">WebMD</a>
 has to say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>    After surgery, you may have a nasal splint or pack placed in your nostrils 
    to stop bleeding and keep the septum straight while it heals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The use of the term 'splint' doesn't really do them justice. Splint is such
a small dainty word that I don't think it accurately reflects what happens.
Here I've rewritten that description to better reflect reality:
</p>
<blockquote><p>    After surgery, you may have canoe paddles shoved into your nostrils 
    to stop bleeding and keep the septum straight while it heals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You have no idea how deep your sinus cavity is. It is apparently deep enough
that you can have four inch long pieces of plastic shoved into them
well past the nostrils and then sown into place.
</p>
<p>And left there. </p>
<p>For a week. </p>
<p>This, as you might imagine, is not comfortable. 
Not actually painful, mind you, but there is something about having
canoe paddles touching the back of my sinus cavity, pressing up 
against the bottom of, oh, what should be there, let me remember, oh yeah, <b>my brain</b>, 
that rendered me completely incapable of rational thought. 
Yes, I was on Oxycodone for the first week, but even 
after I stopped taking them on Friday them I was still 
addled until the splints were removed the following Monday.
During my recovery I received my copy of Slide:ology, among other books, but 
I read it first since it had the largest amount of white space and the
prettiest pictures. Well, I tried to read it during my short
wakeful periods. Occasionally I would stop
and take a break and when I picked the book back up just for fun
I would go back and read back a page from where I stopped.
The last page I'd read, you'd think I'd remember it. Nope. It was 
all brand new. Now that I'm fully recovered I look forward to 
reading it again and actually retaining something this time.
</p>
<p>Lynne was a great help and endured my being addled with
aplomb. At one point we were having a conversation and it seemed
vaguely familiar. "Have we had this conversation before?"
"Several times," she responded.
</p>
<p>Now, this is real surgery, and there is real blood involved, and one of things
you need to do is have some gauze taped under your nose to catch the blood 
before it drips out onto your shirt. This is what I refer to as the 'nose diaper'.
I've included a handy drawing of the proper way to prepare such a 'nose diaper'
to help you, should you decide to have this surgery. This is probably different than what 
you will be shown at the hospital, as my nurse rolled up two or more sheets of gauze and taped the 
resulting thick ball wadding under my nose, which is both uncomfortable and almost completely ineffective
for various hydrodynamic reasons I won't bother to explain.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/2008/10/nose1.png" style="float: right;" />
<p>The thoughtful reader at this point will note that there are two exits from the nose, the 
first out the front and the second down the back of your throat. 
There's no nose diaper you can construct for the flow of blood
that exits that way. That explains the second prescription that I was given for the
surgery: Promethazine, an anti-nausea medicine. 
</p>
<p>For the first week my wakeful time was really small, only about 4 hours a day, 
usually in one hour windows where I would get a drink, eat a very small meal, take
another Oxycodone and maybe a Promethazine, change the nose diaper and then go back to sleep. Over the course
of that first week I lost five pounds.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/2008/10/nose2.png" style="float: left;" />
<p>By the time I got to Thursday I was starting to feel a little better and tried to
get up and move around the house some more, even going so far as to cook. 
This was a mistake, one for which I suffered four nose bleeds 
over the course of the evening, some of them involving a large amount 
of blood. I believe it was the third nose bleed when I was standing over the sink
with blood running out my nose and out my mouth at the same time that I heard one of my family members 
remark, "Wow, that's more blood than on <a href="http://www.fox.com/fringe/">Fringe</a>."
</p>
<p>Based on all that blood on Thursday I went in for a checkup on Friday and one of the 
doctors 'cleaned out' my nose and the splints, which it turns out were hollow and I was supposed to
be able to breath through them. He started off this process by taking two Q-Tips, dipping them
into water or maybe hydrogen-peroxide and then shoving them down into the splints to 'loosen things up'.
I will not lie, even with the Oxccodone and local anesthetic he gave me, that hurt. He then proceeded to use a suction nozzle to 
suck 'stuff' out of my nose. To be clear, blood tends to do that clotting thing and those clots
have been hanging out in the newly renovated jungle-gym that was my nasal cavity for a week.
I had a grim moment of pride when the small suction nozzle became clogged and the doctor had to switch to 
the large suction nozzle. That too became clogged but he was able to use it to drag out 
very large and colorful 'things', some of which were over a foot long.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/2008/10/nose3.png" style="float: right;" />
<p>The Monday following the surgery I went in to have the splints removed, which was a trememdous
relief. 
</p>
<p>Remember the old coffee stirrers they used to have, the ones that look 
like two tiny straws glued together. When I was a kid we'd
get those and try to use them as straws, and you had to work real hard
to get any soda through them. Now imagine if someone switched out that
straw while you weren't looking and you took another sip out of that
now-normal sized straw. You'd suck too hard and a get a huge rush of 
soda in your mouth. That was exact thing I experienced repeatedly
in the fifteen minutes after the splints were removed.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Breathe. "Whoa, Big Straw!"
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Breathe. "Whoa, Big Straw!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>But after only 15 minutes I was breathing normally through my nose. And by normal
I mean normal as in apparently most-humans-breathe-this-way normal. 
</p>
<p>
After just one or two nights I was breathing through my nose 
when I slept, I expected it to take longer to unlearn forty years of habit.
</p>
<p>My sense of smell is returning, but sporadically. Two weeks out from the 
surgery I can smell most things if I put them up close to my nose and it is improving
a little every day. There are, however, weird periods where my sense of smell
goes into overdrive and my nose picks out one thing to smell. For example, earlier this week
I walked out into the back yard and was struck by the overwhelming smell of some charred 
wood in the chimenea 20 feet away. A minute or two later it passed and I could 
barely smell the charred wood when I put my head right up to the little fire place.
I have had those super-smell moments two or three times a day after the splints were
removed, sometimes to the most disgusting of odors, but they seem to be decreasing 
in frequency as my normal sense of smell returns.
</p>
<p>
All in all it was a totally miserable experience, but the end result is well worth it.

    Get well soon, Joe!

The Wife had one about a year ago. In the end, it paid off. But I was painful, both for her, her mother and me.

    You have my sympathy Joe.

Hope it mends quickly. 

Good luck.

    I think you've got our sympathy. Part way through I was getting ready to tell my story of pain involving several of my teeth, but by the end I think, no, yours was more grim.

    I had a similar surgery myself some years ago. I was so dulled with pain at the time that I only remembered later how much pain I was in. I had to sleep sitting up for almost a month. But again, it has mostly been worth it - when I have a cold now, at least one nostril is clear ;)

    Joe, I went through something similar a few years back. In my case, one of the turbinates had an air-bubble in it (called a 'concha bulosa) that was causing poor drainage leading to various chronic upper-respiratory infections, including in my tonsils (which is what I originally had decided to finally get taken care of). This had also caused some deviation of my septum, but no real blockage (except when I had a cold). The various xrays taken also determined that the turbinate was also growing a bone-spur sideways and would in a few years start causing some *major* problems.

The solution was to basically remove the turbinate. This involved the same kind of splints, though in my case they needed to use the XXL size ones due to the large schnozz (and skull) I inherited.

They also discovered quite a few 'interesting' things trapped in my sinus cavity that had been blocked in by the turbinate and were in the process of calcifying. Suffice it to say that they decided to roto-rooter them out since they were already up in there.

The splints (even though XXL) didn't press on my brain and affect cognition much, but the pressure-relief from the roto-rootering (and later again from the splint *removal*) did.

I had more-or-less the same experience for removal of the splints. The footlong 'very large and colorful things' were in my case the artificial-skin-like packing material they had sprayed rather liberally in there. After the splint removal I had to go back several times to have them pull out ginormous rock-hard clots (some approximately 3/4" in diameter) that kept forming and blocking my nasal cavity, and eventually to have them remove the last stitches.

Still, like you, it was worth it, as the throat and tonsil infections have nearly completely abated in the years since, though I now have to use a saline spray semi-regularly to keep things moist up in there (that being one of the functions of the turbinate).

    Okay - I have a question!
I had septoplasy/turbinate reduction about two weeks ago. My nose is starting to recover, however I have been having unbelievable tooth pain. All of my teeth hurt severely. I went back to the surgeon yesterday. It was explained to me that it has to do with the nerves. And also that I had an abnormal amount of inflammation and swelling. He prescribed steroids. They seem to maybe be working! I am concerned about nerve damage. Has anyone else had this specific experience with this surgury?

    <p>Wow, I had totally forgotten about the tooth pain, I would get random pin-pricks of pain across my teeth for a minute and then it would subside, but it went away after the first two days. Good luck with your recovery.
