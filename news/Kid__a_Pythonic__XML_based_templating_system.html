  <p>I have got way too many projects going on at any one time, but
 one of the things that has always bothered me in Python 
 is the lack of a good templating system and I've always wanted
 to write my own. I've used Cheetah but it's 
 just a text templating facility and knows nothing of XML so 
 producing well-formed XML with it is tricky. On the other hand
 <a href="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TAL">TAL</a> 
 looks good but sits on top of a very large framework. 
  If I were to design my own <em>perfect</em> 
 templating system for Python it would be XML based, 
 with syntax like TAL, and a structure like PHP that allows
 putting pure Python on processing instructions. It would also
 be just a library and not part of a framework.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the Python community is
  that if you procrastinate long enough someone else will 
  come along and write the code you want; which is exactly
  what Ryan Tomayko did with his newly released library 
  <a href="http://kid.lesscode.org/">Kid</a>, a 
  Pythonic, XML-based templating system.

    TAL/ZPT is actually very independent of Zope, and has been distributed independently from nearly its beginning.

    <p>Two pointers to TAL/ZPT implementations separate from the Zope framework:</p>
<p>SimpleTAL - <a href="http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/">http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/</a></p>
<p>OpenTAL - <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/opental/">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/opental/</a></p>
<p>I've used both of these with some satisfaction in my personal projects, but I'm hoping to get into Kid at some point.</p>
