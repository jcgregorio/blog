    My last day at InfoWorld will be Friday Dec 15. On Jan 15, after a month-long sabbatical, I'll become a Microsoft employee.

   While on vacation I got some kidding from my father-in-law about
   joining "The Evil Empire". No, he wasn't talking about Microsoft, in his day
   that title fell to IBM. Times change and over the next few years I expect
   that mantle to shift again from Microsoft to Google. Not that I think IBM, MS or Google
   is evil. It's just that it is an unavoidable
   label as the brains and bravado of a new tech sector get distorted
   through the lens of a monopoly to appear as arrogance.

    Jon joining MS is just one more sign that MS is making that transition.
