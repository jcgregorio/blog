    As we head into the fourth week of Pat McCrory&#39;s failure to conceeed in
    the NC gubernatorial race, it&#39;s important to look at McCrory&#39;s infantile
    behavior in a larger context. While it would be tempting to try to
    psychoanalyze his continued intransigence as yet another man-child temper
    tantrum, there are larger forces at work, of which McCrory is just a
    sad symptom.
  </p>
  <p>
    The root of the problem stems from the ever widening wealth gap, and
    subsequent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-11-20/blame-rich-overeducated-elites-as-our-society-frays">elite
      overproduction</a>. As more and more millionaires and billionaires are
    minted they seek to convert their newfound wealth into political power.
    But the levers of power are limited, there&#39;s a finite number of House and
    Senate seats, there are only 50 governors, and only one President. No
    new power levers are being created, yet there are more and more people
    scrambling for them. More and more millionaires think they should be on
    the city council or run for their state legislature, while more
    billionaires think they too should be President. In a simple example of
    the law of supply and demand, you can see the price of running for office
    rising steeply over the last 40 years, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/the-reporters-35365848">with the cost of
      running for President exceeding $2 billion in 2012</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what happens when the demand outstrips the supply so that no manner
    of money can buy you that cherished lever of power? When there are
    multiple millionaires, each backed by a group of billionaires, all vying
    for power? What do you pay then? You pay in social norms. Common decency. The
    destruction of these are the price you pay. Pat McCrory, in a desperate
    bid to retain his power, is willing to violate every norm of U.S.
    democracy and attempt to destroy all faith in the election process, the
    same process that put him in power four years ago. If Pat McCrory can&#39;t be
    governor, well then, he might as well burn down the entire edifice so no
    one else can be either.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also see this playing out on the national stage, with Donald Trump
    willing to violate every norm, digging deep into the veins of xenophobia,
    racism, and bigotry to propel himself into office. Under normal
    circumstances no politician would openly court the worse side of the human
    tribal instinct, the horrors from the last rise of fascism leading up to
    WWII have been too close and too fresh in memory. But time has passed, the
    last survivors of WWII are dying out, the reality of tens of millions of
    people dying in wars, revolutions, and pogroms are just dry history
    lessons now, not to be considered in the raw and ugly scramble for power.
  </p>
  <p>
    So don&#39;t blame Pat McCrory, as infantile and destructive as his behavior
    has become, he is just a symptom of a much larger breakdown in political
    norms, and these are just a couple steps along a longer arc of societal
    disintegration. We&#39;re already seeing the normal U.S. two-party system
    fragment into five distinct parties; the neo-liberal wing of the
    Democratic party as exemplified by Hillary Clinton, the populist wing of
    Bernie Sanders followers, the traditional big business GOP, the Tea Party
    republicans, and finally the Trumpers. And this isn&#39;t the end of the
    disruption, merely the beginning. Layer on global warming, the continued
    disruption of technology, and the world wide migration of people from
    rural areas into cities, and we have all the ingredients for massive
    upheaval. Will we descend into our own Cultural Revolution, shatter the
    country in another Civil War, or will the similar rise of fascism across
    Europe lead to another world engulfing spasm of death and desctruction?
    <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/10/01/breaking-point-america-approaching-a-period-of-disintegration-argues-anthropologist-peter-turchin/">The
      patterns are all there, the roots of the problem can be clearly mapped
      out, and while there&#39;s no guaranteed way to avoid the coming
      disintegration, maybe we should at least try</a>.
