  <p>In his post on <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/27/dynamically_extending_apis.html">Dynamically Extending API's</a> 
Mark provided the groundwork for some Python code I was working
on at the same time. Mark ends up creating a list of tuples from an 
RSS file. What I needed was to run over an RSS file and produce
a dictionary for each 'item' encountered. In addition I needed
the namespace mapping to be "fixed". In this case "fixed"  means
that 'dc' always maps to the Dublin Core namespace. It is one 
of the flexibility/difficulty tradeoffs you make when you choose
to use XML. That is, the chosen pre-fix for an element in a namespace
need not be the same from document to document. For example the following
two documents should be treated exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;item xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;MetaData&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;dc:date&gt;2003-01-12T00:18:05-05:00&lt;/bc:date&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;http://bitworking.org/news/8&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Upon waking, the dinosaur...&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;root:item xmlns:bc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:root="" &gt;
  &lt;root:title&gt;MetaData&lt;/root:title&gt;
  &lt;bc:date&gt;2003-01-12T00:18:05-05:00&lt;/bc:date&gt;
  &lt;root:link&gt;http://bitworking.org/news/8&lt;/root:link&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Upon waking, the dinosaur...&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/root:item&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In either case the desired output should be
a dictionary populated as such:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>{ 'link': 'http://bitworking.org/news/8', 
  'dc:date': '2003-01-12T00:18:05-05:00', 
  'description': 'Upon waking, the dinosaur...', 
  'title': 'MetaData'}
</code></pre>
<p>I needed code that would retreive all the sub-elements of 'item'
and present them in a dictionary that maps the element name to
it's value, with all the elements names being "fixed".</p>
<p>Building off of Mark's code <a href="http://bitworking.org/archival/XmlToDict.py.txt">XmlToDict.py</a> does all that.
Note that it has unit tests in the file that demonstrate how it operates.
One other thing to note is the 'seperator' setting. This allows you to control
the seperator to use when building up the dictionary keys. In the unit tests
the ':' seperator is used so that element names are mapped as you would 
expect them in an XML file. For example 'dc:date'. This can be changed to use
another character, which comes in handy if you are using a <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">templating</a>
system that doesn't like colons in its dictionary keys.</p>
