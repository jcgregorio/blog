  <p>I don't know how I missed this, but back on September 23 ESR's book 
  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/index.html">The Art of Unix Programming</a>
  went to Rev 1, which means it is the version of the content
  that is going into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131429019/bitworking-20">the print book</a>. </p>

<p>There is <strong>a lot</strong>
  of information in there and I have only skimmed a few chapters
  but I found them all excellent. For example 
  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch07s03.html#id2923889">
  Threads - Threat or Menace?</a> stresses using multiple processes over threads.
  That brought back memories of a multi-threaded Windows application I 
  did at my last job. We had upwards of 5 threads running in that 
  application and we had all the synchronization and memory sharing 
  problems you'd expect with such a system. These weren't just 5 identical worker
  threads all doing the same task, no each one was handling a 
  different task, and all the data the application was handling 
  got piped through some subset of the threads. On one hand, under Windows,
  threads are extremely cheap, spawning them is easy and they take up
  very few resources. On the other hand, as ESR points out in his book, 
  it's not the threads that are the problem it's the <acronym title="Inter-Process Communication">
  IPC</acronym> and locking that will get you. As far as running 5 threads 
  we were pretty happy with ourselves for that, 
  mostly because one of the applications we worked with most was 
  MS Outlook which at times had upwards of 13 threads running.
