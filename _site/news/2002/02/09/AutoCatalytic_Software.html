      <p>Open source software (OSS), the development model of wildly popular projects
like Linux, Apache and Perl, is compared with closed source software (CSS),
the development model of proprietary software projects. The two models
of development are compared by viewing the processes from the perspective
of a text file.</p>

  
<h2>OSS versus CSS</h2>
Open source software (OSS), the development model of wildly popular projects
like Linux, Apache, Perl, BSD, etc. is characterized by the ability to
get, modify and redistribute the source code for programs and documentation.
As described at <a href="http://www.opensource.org/intro.html">opensource.org:</a>
<blockquote>"The basic idea behind open source is very simple. When
programmers
on the Internet can read, redistribute, and modify the source for a piece
of software, it evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, people fix
bugs. And this can happen at a speed that, if one is used to the slow pace
of conventional software development, seems astonishing.
<p>       We in the open-source community
have learned that this rapid evolutionary process produces better software
than the traditional closed model, in which only a very few programmers
can see source and everybody else must blindly use an opaque block of bits."
</p><p>  --Open Source Initiative</p></blockquote>

Closed source software (CSS) is the traditional development model of
proprietary
software projects. The source code to a program is held by a company as
a jealously guarded trade secret and only the binaries built from the source
code are distributed.
<br />
<h2>Its all about text files.</h2>
Software development can be viewed as the production and processing of
text files. From operating systems to compilers to web pages almost all
of software development either begins or ends with text files. The source
code for the compiler is a text file. The HTML of the web page you are
currently viewing is a text file. The CGI script that served it up is a
text file. If you view OSS from the persepective of the text-files that
make it up then OSS is about text files that can act on other text files.
For example, the source code for a compiler is compiled into a new version
of the compiler which then is used to compile Perl which is then used to
process CGI scripts for an Apache web server to serve up custom HTML pages
that interface to the CVS server for the source code for the complier.
<p>The ability of text files to move from computer to computer and to be
modified are the corner stones of OSS.  The GPL and similar copyrights
give text-files the <b>liberty</b> to travel from computer to computer.
These copyrights are written not to restrict the circulation of the text
file, but to make sure their circulation is never restricted.. From the
definition of <a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">Copyleft</a>:
<br />
<blockquote>"Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software,
with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and
change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom."</blockquote></p><p></p><p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>  --Free Software Foundation</blockquote>
</blockquote>
The Internet gives text-files the <b>freedom</b> to travel from computer
to computer. Without such an electronic medium the transportation of all
these text files would be impossible.
</p><p>In the context of this article I am using very specific definitions
of freedom and liberty. Freedom is having the means to attain a goal while
liberty is the permission to go after that goal. For example, while everyone
in the U.S.A. has the liberty to travel to Europe, not many have the money
to afford the plane ticket. People who lack the money for the plane fare
have the liberty to travel to Europe but not the freedom to travel to
Europe.
It is important to note that for a trip to Europe to take place both freedom
(money) and liberty (passport) must be in place. The <b>freedom </b>for
the textfiles to travel and interact comes from the GPL or similar
copyrights.
The <b>liberty</b> comes from almost free (or like the case of Juno,
literally
free) internet access. These are the minimum requirements for such a system
to take hold.
</p><p>So our GPL'd text-files have both freedom and liberty. As these
text-files
travel around they may accumulate features, bug fixes and other changes.
Fitter text-files spread farther and wider, increasing further their chances
of accumulating changes that are even more beneficial. What is a fitter
text-file? It is one that is useful to people in it's own right like the
documentation for Perl, or it has great utility in it's compiled form,
like the sources to Linux. The further a text-file spreads the more likely
it will end up on the desk of someone that can easily fix a bug or add
a feature. The text files living in OSS projects exist in an ecosystem
defined by Internet and the GPL. Note that like our trip to Europe, both
freedom (Internet) and liberty (GPL) are both pre-requisites.
</p><p>So far the system I have described is classical Darwinism. But that
isn't satisfactory enough to explain the explosive growth of OSS. OSS has
been chugging along in the background for the past 15 years. Why is it
just now exploding across the scene? I believe the size of code that fits
into the OSS model has reached critical mass. Let's look beyond Darwinism
and into complexity theory. Stuart Kaufman defines a collectively
autocatalytic
system as:

<blockquote>    "Many chemical reactions proceed only with
great difficulty. Given a long expanse of time, a few molecules of A might
combine with molecules of B to make C. But in the presence of a catalyst,
another molecule we'll call D, the reaction catches fire and proceeds very
much faster. The usual metaphor is the lock and key: A and B fit into slots
on D, in just such a way that they are far more likely to combine to form
C. As we shall see, this is a vast oversimplification, but for now it will
suffice to get the point across. While D is the catalyst that joins A and
B to make C, the molecules A, B, and C might themselves act as catalysts
for other reac-tions.
<br />    At its heart, a living organism is a system of
chemicals
that has the capacity to catalyze is own reproduction. Catalysts such as
enzymes speed up chemical reactions that might otherwise occur, but only
extremely slowly. What I call a collectively autocatalytic system is one
in which the molecules speed up the very reactions by which they themselves
are formed: A makes B; B makes C; C makes A again."
<p>    -- Stuart Kaufman</p></blockquote>
Compare this with our model of open source software development. The source
code for a compiler is compiled into the compiler which then is used to
compile perl which is then used to process cgi scripts for an apache web
server to serve up custom HTML pages that interfaces to the CVS server
for the source code for the complier, etc, etc, etc. At some point in the
very recent past the whole system could be done using only OSS text files
and at that point the system became collectively autocatalytic.
</p><p>This is where the whole OSS community owes a great debt to those
dedicated
few that over many years built the collection of open source to the point
where it has reached critical mass. The outcome was inevitable; there
eventually
would have been a large enough collection of open code accumulating over
the years until the whole mass sprang to auto-catalytic life, but the
tireless
efforts of those pioneers has brought that day much sooner.
<br />
<h2>How does this compare to CSS?</h2>
Now how does this compare to the life of a text-file in a CSS? Because
of a restrictive copyright, the text-files that make up a proprietary
program
do not have the liberty to travel to many computers. The pool of computers
the text-files are allowed to travel to is limited to the software
developers
in the company. The chances of accumulating beneficial features and
bug-fixes
are still high since the developers are paid to make those changes, but
the bugs won't get fixed as fast nor will the features get added as quickly.
That is because the chances that a bug-fix or feature is easy to fix is
proportional to the number of people looking at the code. The more people,
the more likely the bug or feature will be obvious to at least one person.
Like chemicals isolated in a small beaker, they will never attain the
complexity
of interactions to achieve an auto-catalytic life.
<h2>Summary</h2>
This analysis does point out a potential weakness of the system. As was
discussed earlier both freedom (Internet) and liberty (GPL) are required
for this text-file ecosystem to flourish. Connecting to the internet is
only going to become easier and cheaper, so the requirement of text file
freedom is in no danger. On the other had text file liberty could come
under attack. If a company or organization were opposed to OSS then their
only available strategy that could slow things down would be to attempt
to use Intellectual Property litigation against the OSS community. This
is the only way they could restrict the liberty of the text-files to travel
and thus break one of the underpinnings of OSS. Fortunately, as we saw
earlier, the OSS is a collectively autocatalytic system and their litigation
tactic would have to restrict an enormous amount of code in order to break
the collectively autocatalytic reaction.
