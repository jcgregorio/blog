  <p>I've complained about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/">XLink</a> in the past. I expect to complain about
   XLink in the future.</p>
  <p>, 
  In particular about the crippling
  deficiency that every instance of a <em>simple</em> link 
  needs to specify not only xlink:href, but xlink:type with
  a value of "simple". I was therefore
  pleasantly suprised to see a Working Group Note published by
  the W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink10-ext/">Extending XLink 1.0</a>, written
  by the inestimable <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2005/01/31/xlink">Norm Walsh</a>.
  That Working Group Note outlines how XLink could make xlink:type an 
  application-level default, which would fix the above problem. <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/archives/2005/01/29/linking-xml-documents/">
  Dave Megginson</a> also holds out hope that XLink could be changed for the better.
</p>
<p>After a brief and shining moment, where I held out a glimmer of hope,
  it all came crashing down and I have little confidence of this happening
  any time in the near future. If you read the "Note" carefully you will see that it
  is just a note, a document of record, something to be referenced when and if 
  the XLink Working Group gets around to a 1.1 version. But lo, as Dave points out,
  the XLink Working Group is no longer active. While it is stated in the XLink 
  Working Groups page that, "Responsibility for maintenance of documents issued 
  by the WG rests with the XML Core Working Group in the first instance.", and Norm
  is a member of the XML Core WG, and the above Note was published by the 
  XML Core WG, I just don't think it will happen any time soon. Never doubt
  the ability of byzantine bureaucracy and political shenanigans to trump 
  common sense.

    <p>The whole point of the note, as outlined in the Core WG minutes<br />
(discussion now happily in the public instead of W3C member only), was<br />
to set the stage for a Charter revision that will allow the XML Core<br />
WG to pursue XLink 1.1:</p>

<p>I hope that we can get XLink 1.1 started, and finshed, this spring.</p>
