  <p>Tim Bray has posted <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/PaceDontSyndicate">
  a proposal</a> on the Atom wiki for a method of tagging 
  an entry as 'not for syndication'. As Tim explains in his 
  <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/16/HowToPost">
  entry on ongoing</a>, his motivation is for pictures, and to nix
  multipart/alternative:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The motivation for doing this was to get rid of the type="multipart/alternative"feature in the current Atom drafts, which strikes me as a "wouldn't-this-be-nice" kind of thing that doesn't do a good job on the most common use-cases. But I think this syndicate="false" idea ends up generally increasing the usability of the whole Atom protocol.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is good. First I have my doubts about 'multipart/alternative'.
  Second this broaches the issue of the 'state' of an entry. While 'syndicate' is 
  one such state surely there are others. How about 'draft', which would imply 
  that the content should not be published. And what if you have email subscribers
  that get notified when a new entry is published, could that also be rolled into 
  the 'state' of an entry?</p>
<p> Now there are two basic ways to go with how to 
   implement this. One is to create a series of <code>'true' | 'false'</code> valued
  attributes to an entry, such as <code>draft="true"</code> or <code>email="false"</code>.
  An alternative is to add a single 'state' element to entry that contains different
  values, for example <code>&lt;state&gt;draft&lt;/state&gt;</code>. I have no
  preference for either solution, but I would like to see <em>something</em>
  added to track entry state. </p>
