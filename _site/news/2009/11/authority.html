            access to information and influence has been
            flattened</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>There are people horrified by this prospect, but the
            criticism that Wikipedia, say, is not an "authoritative source" is
            an attempt to end the debate by hiding the fact that authority is a
            social agreement, not a culturally independent
            fact.</p></blockquote> 
        <p>Authority, historically, gets bestowed on the gatekeepers of
        information, such as Britannica, universities, newspapers, etc.
        Everything that can be digitized will be digitized, and will then
        be available over the internet, which is disruptive, not only to 
        business models, but to authority.
