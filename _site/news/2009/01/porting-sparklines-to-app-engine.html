        The title of this article is actually misleading
        as the code isn't ported, but altered to run on both
        App Engine and under CGI. App Engine exposes a CGI 
        environment that your requests run under, so the real
        challenge comes from the differences in the runtime
        environment.
        
Imaging

        The first big difference is that PIL (the Python Imaging
        Library) isn't available on App Engine, and it's not possible
        to add C extensions to your App Engine project, so we will have to find
        a pure Python substitute. Such a substitute exists in
        pngcanvas, a pure Python module for creating PNG images.
        

        My use of pngcanvas is actually the completion of a virtuous circle: 
        I originally created the Python sparklines service and
        why wanted to create one in Ruby 
        using pure Ruby and BMPs, then that was the jumping off point for some commenters to
        do the same for PNGs, which led 
        mir.aculo.us to create 
        a library for creating sparkline PNGs in pure Ruby, which 
        Rui Carmo then ported to Python, 
        which I will now use in porting the original sparklines code to App Engine.
        Small world.
        

        Now you probably won't want to use pngcanvas for 
        extensive graphics manipulation, but since sparklines
        are small it will be just fine.
        As a side note, I really like the simplicity of the
        pngcanvas interface, the port actually resulted in removing
        lines of code compared to PIL, which is always a good sign.
        

        The one problem that arises in moving from PIL to pngcanvas
        is the lack of color names. PIL allows you to specify
        colors by name, something pngcanvas doesn't support.
        Luckily X11 includes a convenient list of color names
        and their equivalent in RGB triples (/etc/X11/rgb.txt)
        which just needs to be converted into a form usable for
        Python. I could write code to import rgb.txt via Python, but
        since I have to upload the file to App Engine anyway, I'll 
        exercise the macro capabilities of my text editor and
        covert it into a Python file:
        
_colors = {
"snow": (255, 250, 250, 255),
"ghost white": (248, 248, 255, 255),
"ghostwhite": (248, 248, 255, 255),
# ...
"light green": (144, 238, 144, 255),
"lightgreen": (144, 238, 144, 255)
}
def colors(name):
    name = name.strip().lower()
    if name in _colors:
        return _colors[name]
    else:
        return (0, 0, 0, 255)

        Now I can use rgb.py to covert color names into RGB triples, 
        or in this case RGBA tuples like pngcanvas expects. 
        
App.yaml

        If we wanted to do the absolute minimum then
        that would be all the changes we would need to make.
        The only extra step needed for App Engine is to describe
        the files we are using and their location so it knows
        what to upload and how to direct requests, which is done
        through the app.yaml file.
        
application: sparklines-bitworking
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: /
  static_files: index.html
  upload: index.html
- url: /spark.js
  static_files: spark.js 
  upload: spark.js 
- url: /spark.cgi?.*
  script: spark.py


        And were done. But there are some other changes we can make
        to take full advantage of the App Engine platform.
        
The main() optimization

        If your handler script exports a main() function
        that takes no arguments then App Engine will keep the script
        cached and call main() for subsequent requests. 
        Skipping the evaluation of the script on each
        request improves performance, so we'll break out the code into two modules,
        main.py which will be our script handler
        and script.py which will contain
        all of the sparkline drawing logic.
        That change is now reflected in our app.yaml
        file:
        
application: sparklines-bitworking
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: /
  static_files: index.html
  upload: index.html
- url: /spark.js
  static_files: spark.js 
  upload: spark.js 
- url: /spark.cgi?.*
  script: main.py
        
And the main.py is very simple:
from spark import plot
def main():
    plot()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()  
Memcache

        Now the original sparklines code already made good use
        HTTP caching by setting ETag: and Cache-control: headers, but
        we can do more under App Engine by using the memcache service.
        After drawing each sparkline we can store the PNG in 
        memcache using a hash of the incoming request query 
        parameters and the application version as the key 
        and subsequently look for images in memcache when 
        requests come in using that same hash. If there is a hit we can avoid 
        doing any drawing at all.
        We still want to be able to use the code on a
        system that doesn't have memcache support so
        we will make its use conditional.
        
try:
    from google.appengine.api import memcache
except:
    memcache = None

Check for memcached images:
def plot():
    plot_types = {
        'discrete': plot_sparkline_discrete, 
        'impulse': lambda data, args: plot_sparkline_discrete(data, args, True), 
        'smooth': plot_sparkline_smooth,
        'error': plot_error
    }
    if not os.environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] in ['GET', 'HEAD']:
        error("Status: 405 Method Not Allowed")
    if_none_match = os.environ.get('HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH', '')
    hashkey = entity_hash()
    if if_none_match and hashkey == if_none_match:
        not_modified()
    if memcache:
        image_data = memcache.get(hashkey)
        if image_data is not None:
            ok()
            sys.stdout.write(image_data)
            sys.exit()
    form = cgi.FieldStorage()
    # ...
    
Populate memcache with images after drawing them:

    # ...
    image_data = plot_types[type](data, args)
    if memcache:
        memcache.add(hashkey, image_data)
    # ... 
    

    By making the use of memcache conditional on its presence
    this code can now be used both on App Engine and also on my 
    server which doesn't have memcache. 
    

    This service can be found hosted at 
    both http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/ 
    and on Google App Engine at http://sparklines-bitworking.appspot.com/.
    Both are running the identical code, which can be found at  
    http://bitbucket.org/jcgregorio/sparklines/overview.

        The title of this article is actually misleading

        App Engine and under CGI. App Engine exposes a CGI
