        <blockquote><p>Scientists have been manipulating genes for decades;
            inserting, deleting, and changing them in various microbes has
            become a routine function in thousands of labs. Keasling and a
            rapidly growing number of colleagues around the world have
            something more radical in mind. By using gene-sequence information
            and synthetic DNA, they are attempting to reconfigure the metabolic
            pathways of cells to perform entirely new functions, such as
            manufacturing chemicals and drugs. Eventually, they intend to
            construct genes &#x2014; and new forms of life &#x2014; from
            scratch.</p></blockquote> 
        <p>Interesting article, I hadn't realized how far synthetic biology had advanced.</p>
        <p>I expect a hysterical Time magazine cover story
        with a Frankenstein cell by the end of the year.
