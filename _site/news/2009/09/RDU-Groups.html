        <p>The RDU area is really hopping these days with 
        technology groups and events. <a href=http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU>BarCampRDU</a> just
        happened last month, along with <a href=http://igniteraleigh.com/>Ignite Raleigh</a> which
        I sadly missed. Just recently I discovered there is a <a href=http://www.trigtug.org/>Triangle GTUG</a>,
        one of many <a href=http://www.gtugs.org/>GTUGs (Google Technology User Group)</a>, and 
        an <a href=http://www.meetup.com/RDUWavelets/>RDU Wavelets group on Meetup.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>And to cut off any complaints, yes, there are plenty of older and more established
        groups in the area also, like <a href=http://trizpug.org/>TriZPUG</a>, <a href=http://trijug.org/>TriJUG</a>,
        <a href=http://www.tripug.org/>TriPUG</a>, <a href=http://www.trilug.org/>TriLUG</a>. 
        </p><p>
        The contrarian in me wants to build another major city in the region and force everyone
        to rename themselves to Quad__UG.</p>
