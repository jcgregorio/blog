        Edward L. Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard, has a blog
        at the NYTimes and has published one blog post in a series that 
        looks at President Obama's high-speed rail plan. The article in
        question, "<a href=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/running-the-numbers-on-high-speed-trains/>Running
            the Numbers on High-Speed Trains</a>" in theory does a simple analysis
        on the President's high-speed rail plan, because, you know, numbers don't lie. 
        As you could expect from a fresh-water economist the entire analysis is load of bunk, staring with the premise
        of using an imaginary 240 mile link between Dallas and Houston, which avoids using any of the
        proposed routes which have been studied and approved for high-speed rail, but instead
        connecting two cities with some of the worst suburban sprawl in the United States. It only gets worse as it only looks
        at the upfront capital costs and fails to do a comparitive run of the numbers for road and air travel.
        There are many more flaws and they're all pointed out in the comments, plainly obvious 
        to many readers, all of whom we suppose are not economics professors at Harvard, to which 
        Professor Glaeser never responds, neither in the comments nor in later blog posts in
        the series.

        Professor Glaeser, I presume, being an economist with a degree 
        from the University of Chicago, is not accustomed to letting
        reality interfere with a perfectly good analysis, which is his right,
        but let's drop the facade and take this kind of writing over
        to the editorial page or maybe print it in a column, because placing it
        on a blog sets the expectation of interaction, a conversation, something the Professor
        seems uninterested in.</p>
