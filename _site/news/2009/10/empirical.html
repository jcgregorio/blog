        <p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=An+empirical+comparison+of+seven+programming+languages.+Prechelt&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0">
            An empirical comparison of seven programming languages</a>:</p>
        <blockquote><p>
80 implementations of the same set of requirements are       
compared for several properties, such as run time, memory    
consumption, source text length, comment density, program    
structure, reliability, and the amount of effort required for
writing them. The results indicate that, for the given pro-  
gramming problem, which regards string manipulation and      
search in a dictionary, “scripting languages” (Perl, Python, 
Rexx, Tcl) are more productive than “conventional lan-       
guages” (C, C++, Java). In terms of run time and mem-        
ory consumption, they often turn out better than Java and    
not much worse than C or C++. In general, the differences    
between languages tend to be smaller than the typical dif-   
ferences due to different programmers within the same lan-   
guage.

<p>The study was published in 2000 and a lot has changed
in the iterim with lots of progress both in JVMs and
in scripting languages, making me wonder how the same study
would look today.
