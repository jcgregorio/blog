  <p>Do I spy, with my little eye, an actual piece of journalism?
<a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h4Os_NvbBurz0R8IejrDDj-4sRlAD92VLMQ00">Did an AP reported really go out and fact-check a political
speech</a> and not just write a he-said-she-said piece?
Stunning if true, revolutionary if applied consistently. I'm not optimistic though.

<blockquote><p>
PALIN: "I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending ... and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress. I told the Congress 'thanks but no thanks' for that Bridge to Nowhere."
</p><p>
THE FACTS: As mayor of Wasilla, Palin hired a lobbyist and traveled to Washington annually to support earmarks for the town totaling $27 million. In her two years as governor, Alaska has requested nearly $750 million in special federal spending, by far the largest per-capita request in the nation. While Palin notes she rejected plans to build a $398 million bridge from Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents and an airport, that opposition came only after the plan was ridiculed nationally as a "bridge to nowhere."
