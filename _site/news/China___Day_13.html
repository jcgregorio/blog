  <p>Tomorrow is our last day in China. In less than 24
  hours we board a plane for home. I've enjoyed the trip
  but I am looking forward to going home. I miss the boys
  tremendously and can't wait for them to meet their
  sister.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow we will also part company with the eight other
  families we have travelled with, and shared virii with, 
  over the last two weeks.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of the south shore of the Pearl River at night.
   This is a street level view of the same scene we have from 
   our hotel room window.</p>

<p>Today was lot's of little things for finishing up the paperwork.
  First we had to hang around the rooms from 9:30 to 11 just in case
  there were problems with our paperwork, then from at 3:30 we went over
  to the US embassy for the last bit of work for Caden's visa. This is the
  great part, after completing all these reams of paperwork, all 
  notarized and signed and sealed twelve different ways, we still have to 
  stand in front of a government representative and swear that we told
  the truth on all of it. The nice part is that the embassy
  representative was fully aware of 
  the irony of it all and was in good humor about it,
  joking at the end by congratulating us on 
  completing the most bureaucratic process on the face of the planet.</p>
<p>After that was some haggling with an art vendor,
  a group trip to a Dim-Sum restaurant and then back 
  to the hotel to work on some packing.</p>

    <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>Nice to read your story about China.  I'm going to show it to my wife - she keeps saying she wants to adopt a Chinese baby.</p>
<p>Good luck with your new daughter and say 'hi' to Lynne.</p>
