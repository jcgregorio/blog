  <p>
    When trying to port <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks">Robaccia</a> to App Engine the hard part 
    has been finding anything to do. If you remember from my previous
    write-up I started with choosing the components to build on, but
    in the case of App Engine the model classes are already provided
    and the development kit already provides Django templates, which have
    become a favorite of mine, so there's little to choose except for
    a library to dispatch incoming requests. In the intervening
    years since I first wrote about Robaccia I've written my own library 
    to do URL dispatching (<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/163/WSGIDispatcher">WSGIDispatcher</a>) and I'll use that.
  </p>
<p>
    There are other pieces we don't need to construct, for example, the
    SDK comes with a development server so we don't need to write
    that ourselves. We don't need <code>dbconfig.py</code> either.   
  </p>
<p>
    There were two bits of functionality in <code>manage.py</code>, the first was
    to create the tables in the database and the second was to run
    a development server, but neither of those are needed if we
    are running under App Engine; the datastore doesn't require you to
    create tables before operating, and the SDK has it's own development
    server.
  </p>
<p>
    That doesn't leave us with a lot.
    We have our convention of models in <code>model.py</code>, views in <code>view.py</code>,
    url dispatching via WSGIDispatcher in <code>urls.py</code>, and finally all of the
    templates in a <code>templates</code> subdirectory.
    The little bit of glue we need to add is the same as in 
    the original Robaccia which is <code>render()</code>, a convenience
    function for rendering templates.
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">import os
import mimetypes
from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template

def render(start_response, template_file, template_values):
  contenttype, encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(template_file)
  if not contenttype:
    contenttype = "text/html"
  template_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "templates", template_file)
  body = template.render(template_file, template_values)
  start_response("200 OK", [('Content-Type', contenttype)])
  return [body]
</pre>
<p>   
    One of the differences in <code>robaccia.render()</code> under App Engine
    is that we can't access files with a relative path name like was done in the original 
    Robaccia, so we will have to make them absolute using this technique:
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">template_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "templates", template_file)</pre>
<p>
  The <code>app.yaml</code> is very simple since we will do all of our dispatching through <code>main.py</code>:
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">application: robaccia-test-app
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1
handlers:
- url: .*
  script: main.py</pre>
<p>
  You would still need to edit <code>app.yaml</code> if you wanted to include static files, or 
  use HTTPS on some URIs.
  </p>
<p>
    Here is toy blog app to show how things hang together:
  </p>
<p><b>model.py</b> </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">from google.appengine.ext import db

class BlogEntry(db.Model):
  title = db.StringProperty()
  content = db.TextProperty()
  created = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)
  updated = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)  </pre>
<p><b>main.py</b> </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">#!/usr/bin/env python

from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
from urls import urls

def main():
  CGIHandler().run(urls)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
</pre>
<p><b>urls.py</b> </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">import view
from wsgidispatcher import Dispatcher

urls = Dispatcher()
urls.add('/blog/', GET=view.index, POST=view.create)
urls.add('/blog/{id}/', view.member_get)
urls.add('/blog/{id}/edit_form', GET=view.member_edit_form, POST=view.member_update)
</pre>
<p><b>view.py</b> </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">import robaccia
import model
import cgi

def index(environ, start_response):
  entries = model.BlogEntry.all().order("-created").fetch(20)
  return robaccia.render(start_response, 'index.html', locals())

def member_get(environ, start_response):
  id = int(environ['wsgiorg.routing_args'][1]['id'])
  entry = model.BlogEntry.get_by_id(id)
  return robaccia.render(start_response, 'entry.html', locals())

def create(environ, start_response):
  req = dict(cgi.parse_qsl(environ['wsgi.input'].read()))
  model.BlogEntry(title=req['title'], content=req['content']).put()
  start_response("303 See Other", [('Location', '/blog/')])
  return []
   
def member_edit_form(environ, start_response):
  id = int(environ['wsgiorg.routing_args'][1]['id'])
  entry = model.BlogEntry.get_by_id(id)
  return robaccia.render(start_response, 'entry_form.html', locals())
    
def member_update(environ, start_response):
  id = int(environ['wsgiorg.routing_args'][1]['id'])
  entry = model.BlogEntry.get_by_id(id)
  req = dict(cgi.parse_qsl(environ['wsgi.input'].read()))
  entry.title = req['title']
  entry.content = req['content']
  entry.put()
  start_response("303 See Other", [('Location', '/blog/' + str(id) + "/edit_form")])
  return []  
</pre>
<p>From here you have the core of a framework and can grow it in 
  any direction you like. For example, you may not find the WSGI
  interface for pulling out values from the request URI    
  to be very intuitive. We can create a decorator that adds the <a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/routing_args">wsgiorg.routing_args</a>
  as calling parameters:
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def wsgirouting(f):
  """
  Decorator to turn WGSI call into a call the contains
  environ and start_response then all of 
  the 'wsgiorg.routing_args' as *args and **kwargs.
  """
  def wrapper(environ, start_response):
    args, kwargs = environ['wsgiorg.routing_args']
    return f(environ, start_response, *args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper
  </pre>
<p>
  Now our views are a little simpler:  
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">@wsgirouting
def member_edit_form(environ, start_response, id):
  entry = model.BlogEntry.get_by_id(int(id))
  return robaccia.render(start_response, 'entry_form.html', locals())
</pre>
<p>
    The point of this isn't to create yet another Python web framework, just
    like the original article that introduced Robaccia, but to give an overview
    of the pieces that go into a web framework, and in this case, how those
    pieces interact with App Engine. 
    </p>

    If you want to experiment with this code I've added it as a branch 
    to the Robaccia project. To get the code:
    </p>

    Awesome.

I built TiddlyWeb on top of a sort of modified robaccia and once I had the basics working, one of the first things I did was make it run in App Engine. It was brilliantly easy. Go WSGI!

I don't know if you mean this or not, but your WSGIDispatcher link is going back to the original why so many frameworks post, not to anything about WSGIDispatcher itself.
