  <p>My latest article, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/04/14/atomwiki.html">
   An Atom-Powered Wiki</a>, is now available at <a href="http://xml.com">XML.com</a>.
   In this article I cover the steps needed to create
   an Atom Enabled wiki, paying attention in particular
   to the character encoding issues. As <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1760.html">
   Sam Ruby has pointed out</a> character encoding may be the 
   number one cause of ill-formed feeds. The code for both the client
   and the server are both available as downloads from 
   the <a href="http://piki.bitworking.org/piki.cgi">live version of the wiki I describe 
   in the article</a>. If you feel so inclined you can download
   the client and test it against the wiki for yourself, just make sure
   that you have the unicode enabled version of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">
   wxWidgets</a> (<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/name.htm">nee wxWindows</a>).
</p>
<p>At the end of the article I cover two of the 
   most glaring issues with the implementation, first
   that the 'issued' element is not information that is 
   currently stored in PikiPiki, but since the 'issued'
   element is required we just used the 'modified' time
   in it's place. </p>
<p> The second rough spot that was covered is that 
   there is no way to detect before hand which types of
   content an AtomAPI server will accept in a 'content' element.
   There is an entry on the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/AtomApiContentNegotiation">
   Atom Wiki dealing with just this
   issue of negotiating the type of content a server will accept</a>.

   These were the two of the biggest issues, but there are more and they are 
   covered in 
   <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/AtomForWikis">a fairly 
   comprehensive page</a> on applying the Atom API to wikis that, un-ironically,
   is available on the Atom Wiki.

    <p>Great stuff! Exactly the kind of thing needed to find out where Atom's currently lacking, and a good read too ;-)</p>
<p>I'd be interested to see how easily the system could be modified for InterWiki purposes - a bunch of folks are talking about using XHTML as the standard interop language between Wikis (with different WikiMarkup). Hopefully this would make a reasonable Atom payload...</p>
<p>Anyhow, keep up the good work.<br />

    The actual files don't seem to be available anymore - have they been moved elsewhere?

    Sorry about that, the link was broken. I have now fixed it. The files are available at <a href="http://piki.bitworking.org/downloads">http://piki.bitworking.org/downloads</a>

    Many thanks. I'll look into those (I've been thinking of doing a Wiki with an Atom file store, and this will help me cut through most of the red tape ;))
