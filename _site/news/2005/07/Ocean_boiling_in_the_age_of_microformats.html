Well, I have now.
Avoiding plain XML and presentational markup 
   from Tantek Çelik is a collection of links and observations. The takeaway for me
   is that if given the choice between enhancing an already semantically rich format like
   XHTML to carry the data you want or creating new elements in new namespaces, choose
   the former rather than the latter. 


   The marketing message of XML has been for people
    to develop their own tags to express whatever they wanted, 
   rather than being stuck with the limited predefined tag set in 
   HTML. This approach has often been labeled "plain XML" or
   "generic XML" or "SGML, but easier, better, and designed
   just for the Web
  

  The problem with this approach is that while having the
   freedom to make up all your own tags and attributes sounds
   like a huge improvement over the (mostly perceived) limits of  
   HTML, making up your own XML has numerous problems,  
   both for the author, and for users / readers, especially when  
   sharing with others (e.g. anything you publish on the Web) is important.
   

Of course, if you are syndicating microformats then that means that
  someone had to publish that information, so we also get a nice intersection
  of the Atom Publishing Protocol and microformats. I've outlined 
  
    how microformats should interact with the APP 
    on the [atom-protocol] mailing list. 

If you have any doubt how important it is to get this right in the APP
   then go listen to Adam Bosworth's  
  "Database Requirements in the Age of Scalable Services" [via 
  lesscode.org].

To quote Sam Ruby:
My theory is that most of the interesting metadata is in the content.

 atom 
 microformats 
 rest 
 markup 
 xml 

  
    but what about the namespace problem?
sure, profiles can be written and referenced, but what if a page uses two profiles which share a common symbol?

    I'm hoping the last chapter of my book coming out next book will be well received.  In it, I throw together some Python scripts to convert from iCalendar to hCalendar to syndication feed to mod_event-enriched syndication feed... and back to iCalendar again.

  Here is the xpath selection I use to pick out the microformat in my Secure Syndication script:</p>
<p>  //div[contains('encrypted blowfish', @class)]//div[contains('encdata', @class)]</p>
<p>  A lot more than a single class name would have to collide for this to fail.</p>

    <p>"A lot more than a single class name would have to collide for this to fail." - ok in this case, but is everyone else taking such care? (I personally don't think it's likely to be a problem in practice).</p>
<p>I don't disagree on your (and Sam's) general point, but would suggest care when trying to generalise beyond syndication of content+metadata.</p>
<p>Sometimes -</p>
<p>&lt;p class='age'&gt;30</p>
<p> <br />
is appropriate, but sometimes -</p>
<p>&lt;x:age&gt;30&lt;/x:age&gt;</p>
<p>and sometimes even -</p>
<p>age = 30;</p>

    <p>Joe's XPath says:</p>
<p>//div[contains('encrypted blowfish', @class)]//div[contains('encdata', @class)]</p>
<p>But that will have a lot of false negatives: if the class is "blowfish encrypted", or "encrypted&lt;newline&gt;blowfish", or "encrypted&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;blowfish".  (Actually, if I read the HTML spec correctly, the newline should be simply ignored, and can therefore occur in the middle of an attribute name.)  Likewise, there are false negatives; things like "unencrypted blowfish" should not match.</p>
<p>The XPath to match this correctly is more complex.  I think the correct "contains" clause looks something like [contains(concat(" ", translate(@class, " \r\n\t", "  "), " "), " encrypted ") and contains(concat(" ", translate(@class, " \r\n\t", "  "), " "), " blowfish ")].  Except that <br />
"\r", "\n", and "\t" have to be literal carriage return, newline, and tab characters, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Perhaps XPath is not the ideal solution to this problem.</p>

    <p>Joe, great post.  What you're saying, and what Sam Ruby is saying and others who are tired of waiting for complex solutions are saying all makes sense to a lot of folks.</p>
<p>Eric, in response to your questions.</p>
<p>The namespace problem?  The short answer is that it's nothing more than academic chicken-littling.  The internet has worked just fine (at many levels, with many applications, specifications) without namespaces.  Namespaces try to solve a 1% problem while burdening the 99%, which is always bad economics.</p>
<p>What if a page uses two profiles?  This is clearly explained in the XMDP spec.  See <a href="http://gmpg.org/xmdp/description">http://gmpg.org/xmdp/description</a></p>

    <p>I accept Tantek's point in the context of microformat documents. Naming clashes are highly improbable within an individual document. But I'm sorry, the Web <b>does</b> depend on namespaces, in the form of URIs. </p>
<p>(Having said that, the string "Tantek" will take you to his site, using the Google protocol ;-)</p>

    <p>Namespaces exist for human implicitly. When I read a weblog, when I hear the use of words by someone. I usually know after a while, that when Tantek says something, it means this and that with all these consequences (this is the tantek namespace). When Danny says another thing using the same words, the person, the previous words etc define a context to the expression. </p>
<p>It's the basics of all social communications, nothing academic in that :) Another attempt to make devil something which is not, but completely natural and daily.</p>
<p>A very good example of that is "friend" in English and "friend" (ami) in French, it doesn't have the same meaning at all. What most English native speakers call a friend is what French calls "someone you know" or "acquaintance".</p>
<p>Namespaces on the Web are nothing more than that, it helps you to disambiguate things, to give a bit more context. It's not rocket science.</p>
<p> It's just acknowledging the diversity, it's helping to accept the differences. Nothing academics again, just the plain reality of social relationships. :)</p>
