  <meta name="twitter:description" content="  Let me tell you a story.
My son, my oldest son, had two bad habits. Had being the material word. 
His first bad habit was that he would sit at the dinner table with his legs and arms pulled into his shirt. This would stretch out his shirts in the front making him look like he was wearing maternity clothes. I have nothing against maternity clothes, but on an eight year old? Not so much.
His second bad habit was that he would sit at the table and lean real far forward on the front of his chair. He would do this at the same time that he had his arms and legs pulled into his shirt.



He's balanced there between his seat and the table like a weeble-wobble.
You can see where this is going.
Let's take a little break here to discuss my parenting strategies. I firmly believe there are just some things that a child will only learn through experience (read pain). Many times children can just be stubborn, or choose not to believe you, and ignore your warnings. I understand this. I did this myself. No matter how many times my parents told me that the iron was hot, it wasn't until I actually touched it and burned my finger did I believe them. That feeds into my parenting strategy, if they misbehave and end up in pain, I believe that's the right time to reinforce the message, make sure the lesson is tightly coupled with the pain, that way they're less likely to forget.
Back to my son, the weeble. We told him, time and again, not to sit that way at the table. Each time he would stop. Each time we'd catch him doing it again later.
Until, of course, the chair slid out from behind him one day, and having no arms to stop his fall his chin slammed into the corner of the table and then he fell like a sack of potatoes to the floor. I sprung into parenting action, standing over him:
"See! See! I told you not to sit in the chair like that! I told you you would fall and hurt yourself!"
I also picked him up off the floor and comforted him, but you gotta get the message in while the pain is still fresh.
While the pain is still fresh. Let's stop talking about my son. Let's start talking about you. Any by you I mean all the web application developers out there that have been mis-using HTTP. Now I've been telling you over and over how to use HTTP correctly, how to build you web applications in a RESTful manner, and the consequences you could face if you didn't. Well, you didn't listen to me, did you 37Signals? Did you? Now Google releases their Web Accelerator and your application is broken. Apparently you used GET to delete items from Backpack and when Googles Web Accelerator pre-fetches that URI in you web app, items get deleted. Let's make this clear, Google didn't break your application, your application was broken, Google was just the first person to point it out to you. Do you feel the pain? Do you feel it?
"See! See! I told you not to use GET for non-safe and non-idempotent actions! I told you your web applications would break!"
You gotta get the messsage in while the pain is still fresh.
Oh, and the follow up from my little story? My son never sat like a weeble-wobble at the table again.

    Ok - am I missing something or isÂ  possible to do a HTTP DELETE or PUT with HTML?Â  Can you have a href that does a POST instead of a get? (without using javascript?)Â  Assuming you can't, how can developers use RESTful methods from HTML pages?

    <p>I do understand that doing PUT and DELETE operations can't be done from a straight HTML form, but you can always make that a POST instead of a GET. </p>

<p>No. That's the point! POST incurs obligations.</p>

<p>With all the finger-pointing in Google's direction, I was beginning to think that the web-development community would miss the wake-up call.Â  I'm glad to see that some people aren't afraid to make a follow-up call in the event the first goes unanswered.Â  ;-)</p>

    <p>Well in the real world of web development sometimes you need to use a &lt;href&gt; rather than a &lt;form&gt; purely for design reasons. Its historical. HTTP is and has been abused forever. </p>
<p>Now let me assure you I understand the REASONS for RESTful behaviour, and in the Web Services area I can see no reason not to be RESTful, but in the browser we have a problem and like it or now most of the web development community don't even know what a GET is..</p>
<p>Google should have known how many WEB applications misuse HTTP Get and infact you could argue they promoted the use of SES urls, (web accelerator doesn't follow query string urls). </p>
<p>Education and better browsers are whats needed.</p>

<p>Baloney. There is a <b>reason</b> HTML requires you to press a button to execute a POST. That is because POST incurs obligations and GET doesn't. Now you're feeling the pain. Feel it burn.</p>

    <p>I commented on this here:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3292874232"&gt;http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3292874232&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Small question - If GET should never have side effects, then isn't a 304 a bad response?Â  From the HTTP spec:</p>
<p>" In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them. "</p>
<p>So - if you take the purist line (which the spec does not, by my reading), then a 304 response to a GET is bad - it comes in response to a server side state change after a previous request.</p>

    <p>James,<br />
Â  You seem to be confusing /any/ server-side state change with non-idempotency. They are not equivalent concepts. </p>
<p>Besides which a 304 is not returned as a result of a GET, it's returned as a result of a "Conditional GET".</p>

Â  Every browser I know of does conditional-get all the time, so it's a distinction w/o a difference.Â  Most news aggregators do as well.

Â  GET, Conditional GET, and Partial GET all have different semantics. Section 9.1 of RFC 2616. While you're at it, read Section 9.3 on "safe" and "idempotent" methods.

<p>Yup, I think that's the idea:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/05/only_the_paranoid_survive.html">http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/05/only_the_paranoid_survive.html</a></p>
<p>At the same time, I'll probably end up doing what Ian Bicking is going to do; warn people off GWA until we review whatever we have running.</p>
<p>I was involved in a rewriting proxy (aka accelerator) project a few years back. It's pretty wild what these things can do, especially if you have a javascript interpreter intercepting pages. Google can use this to drive their operating costs right down assuming they get people to fix their webapps and aren't forced to withdraw under pressure. The opportunites for gathering click data for session tracking across multiple websites are immense. And I suspect this is just the beginning; eventually accelerators will be used maliciously; using GET for side-effects is also a security problem.</p>
<p>The TAG really should pick this issue up (I'm thinking about HTML forms mainly). It's one thing to preach the right thing; it's another to allow HTMLÂ  and XForms out the door.</p>

    <p>The problem in situations like this though is that 99% of the time these issues don't happen.Â  </p>
<p>Its hard to justify to your boss that you should migrate to using POST when there are no bugs caused by this issue and you already have 100000 bugs and features pressing.</p>

    <p>Joe - due to the way HTML works, it's just not a practical restriction to place on web UI design, that any action which changes state in any way at all, should be the result of the user submitting a form. Maybe in your web apps, but not in general. I don't care if you think that everyone should use form submit buttons for these actions, the wider community disagrees, and finds it very useful to be able to present these kinds of actions as links.</p>
<p>So instead of acting all smug and absolutist about it, you should acknowledge that a problem exists - HTML doesn't give us quite the right tools to comply with the relevant part of the HTTP spec. What we need is a method="POST" attribute on links, for example. Sure you can use javascript to submit a hidden form, but that's an uglyÂ  hack and not everyone has javascript enabled anyway.</p>
<p>Also, idempotency alone isn't sufficient - many state-changing actions are idempotent, but you still don't want Google performing those actions without any user input. What matters is that the action is happening ONCE, as opposed to NOT AT ALL. What happens when the action is repeated more than once isn't very relevant in this context.</p>

Â  "the wider community disagrees, and finds it very useful to be able to present these kinds of actions as links."</p>
<p>Â  The wider community just got burned by Google Web Accelerator. For a reason. That reason is that GET is supposed to be both <b>safe</b> and <b>idempotent</b>. </p>
<p>What amazes me most about the whole affair is that all this pushback is supposedly coming from "professional" developers. Sorry, I get paid to write code. When someone finds a bug, do I complain about the person that found the bug? Ban that person from using my system? Complain about my need to mis-use the underlying technology? Flaunt my ignorance of the underlying specifications? Or do I drag my ass back to my cube and fix the bug the right way? I fix the bug.</p>
<p>Not only do I acknowledge that a problem exists, I actually did something about it, bringing the issue to the attention of the TAG <b>over a year ago</b>:</p>

<p>This is a very common requirement and the standards don't provide a satisfactory way of doing it. So the standards are widely ignored and a new consensus standard forms around common usage. Google have shown a blatant disregard for this consensus standard.</p>

    <p>Also, as a 'professional developer' I (and I expect most others here) have been aware of the issue for quite some time. I try to use forms and POST methods whenever appropriate and possible, although sometimes the only realistic way of presenting the action is as a link, and so I make a concious decision to flout the (inadequate) standards in a widely accepted fashion.</p>
<p>This is what happens when standards fail to meet needs. It's not ideal, but smugly condemning it isn't going to help the problem one bit.</p>

    <p>Matthew,</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to present unsafe actions as links?Â  Links are pointers to resources. They are invitations to fetch those resources, which are presumed to be safe.</p>
<p>Can you present some realistic situations where a sensible design cannot be made using buttons instead of links?</p>
<p>Difficulty certainly isn't a reason to avoid buttons.Â  In my current Rails project, I replaced unsafe links with buttons, and it was easy.Â  All I did was create a 'button_to' method to use instead of 'link_to' for unsafe actions.Â  Ten lines of code.Â  That's it.</p>

    <p>Styling form submit buttons with CSS didn't work consistently cross-browser last time I tried it. I don't think you can get hover effects to work like links either, in IE at least.</p>
<p>Most of the situations where links have been particularly necessary are where the user is given the opportunity to mutate aspects of the UI and site behaviour somehow, or mutate an on-screen object (table, diagram etc) by clicking on what design dictates must be a fairly compact link.Â  Believe it or not some of us have to work with designers, too, who don't appreciate being told certain things have to be presented as form submit buttons.</p>

<p>Â  "So tell me then, how do I present a POST action in the same visual style as a link, without resorting to messy hacks?"</p>
<p>You don't. And that's the point:</p>
<p>From Section 9.1 of RFC 2616:</p>
<p> "In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested."</p>

Â  From section Section 9.1.2 of RFC 2616:</p>
<p>Â  "Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent."</p>
<p>Using a GET for a non-idempotent action, for example, adding an item to your shopping cart, is, as the spec says, a no-no.</p>

Â  In the first place, I was referring to Art's comment, where he seems to be implying that I mis-used the term idempotent. I had said, "I told you not to use GET for non-safe and non-idempotent actions!" As you can see, using GET for a non-idempotent operation is clearly wrong.<br />
<br />
Â  Now, as for your contention: "One could quite easily ensure that a link to add an item to a shopping cart only adds the item once." Can you explain how you would <b>quite easily</b> do that?

    Broken spec + whiny told-you-so developer = hot air.Â  Let's concentrate on fixing the spec.Â  Links vs. buttons are a UI decision not an I/O decision - I think we can agree visual design should be strictly decoupled from I/O.Â  Basically Google screwed up by not taking reality into account, which they do on occasion, let them fix their own turd.Â  If Microsoft did something similar you'd be down their throat in an instant.

<p>Is there a reason this store would forbid customers from buying an item in quantity?</p>
<p>Honestly, I get the feeling that a few people here are just arguing for the sake of argument. Who cares if an action can be made idempotent by severely limiting its functionality? You can make everything idempotent by ignoring repeated requests. Does it honestly affect the applicability of the example? Does it have any meaning?</p>

    <p>Joe,Â  I completely agree with you over theÂ  issue of idempotency.Â  While the current crop of browsers make our lives difficult, that's no excuse for breaking the rules.Â  But Idempotent and safe aren't the same thing.</p>
<p>If your 'add to cart link' is of the form</p>
<p><a href="http://www.example">http://www.example</a>.com/shoppingcart/#{RequestID}/add/#{ItemIDToAdd}</p>
<p>Then you can keep track of the 'requestIDs' which have been processed using either shared memory, or a database table with a unique index.</p>
<p>Having said that, I still use post whenever I'm doing something like this.</p>

<p>Our approach is going to be a link_to_post helper function which creates a form with a javascript link to submit it.Â  Plus a post_button helper which creates the same form but with a proper submit button to submit it.</p>

Â  Glad to hear that you want to get this right.</p>
<p>Â  With respect to your strategy for adding a RequestId to the 'add to cart' link, here are some things to think about:</p>
<p>1. The obvious one is that GWA would follow that link and add the item to your cart.<br />
2. What if I keep changing my mind? What if I add the item to my cart, change my mind and delete it, then change my mind one last time and hit the back button to get back to my starting page and try to add it to my cart again? If you don't keep track of deletions then I won't be able to re-add the item, bacause I can only use that URI once. If you do keep track of deletions then GWA could come behind and re-add items to my cart that I had already deleted.</p>
<p>As you said, you use POST for these kinds of operations, which is good.</p>
