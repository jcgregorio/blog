      <p>Three years ago I <a href="http://bitworking.org/Aug2002.html#X631644799217146336">posted how I had lost 
   20 lbs on the Atkins diet</a>, that was after discovering
   that by just switching from drinking carbonated sodas to tea that I had 'accidentally' lost 10 lbs.
   That was a real eye opening event for me, not only because of the weight loss but because it
   made me realize that my tea drinking and Atkins experience were really body hacking. Of all 
   the things I love to tinker with, wood, software, landscaping, etc., I had never considered
   my own metabolism as something that was up for experimentation. That's one of the big reasons
   that over a year ago our family joined the local YMCA and why I started, of all things, weight
   lifting. If you know me, you know how far from the typical 'me' that sounds. But I did it and 
   have enjoyed it greatly as another venue of body hacking. Over the course of a year 
   I've discovered several things about myself and my metabolism.
</p>
  
<dl>
<dt>Overheating</dt>
<dd>If I don't leave long enough between my sets, particularly 
      when working out in the morning, I will overheat and get nauseaus. Very nauseaus.
      We'll just leave it at that, ok?
   </dd>
<dt>Power versus Endurance</dt>
<dd>When I was younger I did a lot of cycling, putting on
     between fifty and a hundred miles a week on my bike as a teenager
     during the summer. Based on that I initially started working out
     doing long sets, typically 12 to 24 repetitions. Let's just say
     that didn't work out, see the above on 'Overheating'. What I found worked
     much better for me was working on power, doing short sets of five to eight
     repetitions and always working close to the maximum weight I could
     lift. </dd>
<dt>Variety</dt>
<dd>When I took the initial training from the staff at the YMCA
    they had me doing eight or more repetitions and then only adding 
    weight once I could do twelve repetitions regularly. The only
    problem was that quickly led to plateauing, I could lift X twelve times
    but could barley do three repetitions with X+delta, where delta was some small weight.
    What I found works much better for me for adding weight are 6-1's or 
    5-4-3's. For 6-1's you find the weight you can do '6' repetitions at and also find
    your maximum single repetition weight, that's the '1'. Do six repetitions
    at your '6' weight. Now after a break do one repetition at your '1' weight.
    Now add 5% to all your weights and do the 6-1 again. You just lifted 5% more 
    than you ever lifted before. Once I break through to a new weight I 
    work on adding more repetitions. The 5-4-3 is the same as the 6-1, but 
    using the weights at which you can do 5,4 and 3 repetitions respectively.
    There are other variations and along with varying the time between sets, the 
    order of the exercises I do, and a hundred other factors I have a rich area
    of experimentation.
   </dd>
<dt>Free vs Machine</dt>
<dd>I initially used the machines when starting to work out. After 
     several months I tried out free weights and let me tell you;  it's like a whole other 
     world. When using a machine your axes of motion are greatly 
     restricted, you are usually pushing or pulling in just one constrained direction
     and the machine is designed to avoid injury. It's great for when you are just 
     beginning, but when you move from the machines to the free weights
     you realize that you have no muscles for controlling the weights
     in all those other axes of motion. It's a bit intimidating lifting
     what you think is a reasonable weight over your face just to watch your
     arms wave around like saplings in a breeze.
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>When I stared all of this, before losing any weight, I peaked at 180 lbs.
   After being on Atkins I initially lost twenty pounds and in two years following that
   I kept my carbs low and only gained back five of those pounds as fat, bringing be 
   back up to 165 lbs. Since I started lifting I have gained 10 to 15 pounds, but not
   a bit of it has been added fat. Now all of this is in the way of introducing Seth Roberts.
</p>
<p>Seth Roberts, a Berkeley psychologist has taken 
   the idea of self-experimentation to a whole new, and scientific, level.
   He has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/11FREAK.html?ex=1126670400&amp;en=e44dbec0ebb507fc&amp;ei=5070">article
   in the NYTimes</a> and is currently <a href="http://freakonomics.com/times0911.php">guest blogging on the Freakonomics blog</a>. 
   Here is a man that is seriously into body hacking, along the way discovering 
   new ideas about weight loss, health, mood and sleep. How did he discover how to lose weight
   by drinking sugar water, or that watching the talking heads on TV in the morning is 
   good for your mood. It's fascinating because in the same way that Steven Levitt uses
   the tools of economics to answer everyday questions, Seth Roberts uses experimentation 
   and basic statistics to answer basic questions about how the human body works.

    <p>Interesting... In 2003 I lost 25 pounds by switching from Coca Cola to carbonated mineral water ? I <b>need</b> the bubbles, so plain water wasn't an option, but carbonated water is ok. I lost this weight in the course of a summer, no extra diet or anything. Makes you pause really...</p>
<p>I like this concept of body hacking, although the thought of hacking <b>at</b> the body would be disturbing!</p>

    Wow, your experiences at the Y are strinkingly similar to mine at the gym.  I went in at 185, 3 years ago, trying to lose some weight, but now am at 200 lbs (with a much more attractive BMI).  My cardio still needs work though, since I also stick to high-weight/low-rep sets on the free weights.

    Actually, In the past I have made some research about this topic, there was a very good magazine "Muscle Media" ( that used a "scientific approach" about the bodybuilding experience, I learned about the metabolism process and why is better to do cardio early in the morning with an empty stomach,  glycemic index, creatine, low- carb high protein diets, why free weight is better than machines, etc ... Although the book don't have many scientific background, the advices remains: "Body for Life". Much better if you can find the old numbers of the magazine

    I lost about 15 pounds last year (from 175 to 160) by "simply" reading the South Beach Diet and exercising (15 mn light weights and 30-45 mn elliptical, 3-5 times a week.) For the weights, I fully agree: free weights are great! As for the diet, I don't care for the exact recipes of the South Beach Diet yet it opened my eyes figuring out what are good vs bad foods and <em>actually</em> following the guidelines was just enough.

    Always good to hear other lifters experiences. I agree that the free weights add the "control factor" but I have gone back to machines for the heavy stuff. Try the 1-5 rep max weight on a machine in combination with the free weight reps. I found that the limited range of motion (not to mention the safety factor) allowed me to use more weight on the machine. Of course, better yet, the power rack.
