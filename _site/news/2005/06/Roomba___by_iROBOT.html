      <p>We recently bought a Roomba. Here is Lynne's review of the little robotic floor cleaner:</p>
  
<blockquote><p>
After changing all of our carpet over to gorgeous <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Bamboo_Wood_Floor">Bamboo Flooring</a> I went
to Target to get some type of convenient sweeper to use upstairs. I
considered a broom; I looked at electric brooms; I looked at a
carpet/floor sweeper type broom until <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B00022HYIM&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325">Roomba</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00022HYIM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

caught my eye. Once upon a
time I think I saw an ad for one of these things and I thought it was
neat but I assumed it was too expensive. I compared the cost of the
electric broom I had just put in my cart and Roomba. The electric broom
was about $90 while Roomba was $150.
</p>
<div style="float:right">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B00022HYIM&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325"><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00022HYIM.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00022HYIM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
</div>
<p>So - what really <b>is</b> a Roomba?</p>
<p>Roomba is an automatic robotic vacuum cleaner. According to the box it
does as good a job in cleaning as an upright vacuum. It is small
(compared to a regular vacuum cleaner) - only 13 inches in diameter
and 4 tall. It will vacuum under chairs, chests, desks, coffee tables
and other places you might not bother vacuuming regularly. The best
thing is that it doesn't require <b>you</b> - you push a button before you
leave to go out (of course, he can clean while you are home too) and
when you come back, your house has been vacuumed.
</p>
<p>I saved the receipt thinking  surely it won't work well and I will be
heading back to the store to return it... what about falling down stairs?
Will it get all the spots? Can it really suck up well?
</p>
<p>I tried it out  even by the stairs - it got <b>right to the edge</b>, I was
sure it was going down... just as I was ready to grab it before it crashed
down and broke - Roomba turned away and went about cleaning elsewhere.
Corners? Yep, got into every corner - the programming is good - I can't
say I "get it" but it knows where to go so it covers
all the area. It knows when it has vacuumed enough and calls itself
done. How well does it suck up dirt, etc? Well it sucked up one of those
little bouncy balls and tried to suck up a play bracelet that got caught
in the brush.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't need bags - you just dump out the contents of the dust
compartment, which actually holds enough so that it doesn't even fill up
after I clean my whole house. I did learn that you need to pull out the
filter each time though. You can just brush it off and put it back in.
</p>
<p>
There are different models. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B00022HYIM&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325">
Roomba Red </a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00022HYIM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

- the price is $149 but
I find people selling them cheaper on eBay if you like to shop there.
Roomba Red has a clean mode for regular cleaning and a spot mode if you
just want a small area cleaned. Roomba Red comes with a 7-hour charger
but I purchased another charger on eBay that has a 3-hour charger and a
home base. My son calls it Roomba's garage. It is really cool because
Roomba will clean and when he is done he drives back to his home base
all on his own and recharges himself. He will go back to the base if he
is running out of charge too. The base cost $50 with shipping on eBay
and costs $60 + shipping retail. If you buy a 


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B00022HYJ6&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325">
Roomba Discovery</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00022HYJ6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

 model it
comes with this base charger automatically but the Discovery model
retails for about $279.
</p>
<div style="float:right">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B00009PGO5&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=bitworking-20&amp;creative=9325"><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00009PGO5.01._SCTZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitworking-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00009PGO5" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
</div>
<p>Roomba Red comes with 1 virtual wall and Roomba Discovery comes with 2
virtual walls. These are small devices that emit a beam that acts as an
invisible wall so that you can contain Roomba to a single room if you
want. For example, if I just want Roomba to clean my kitchen, I put one
virtual wall in each of the two open doorways to keep Roomba in the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>Roomba can also easily transition from floor to carpet and back. He does
an equally good job on all types of flooring. He finds his way under and
around chairs and other obstacles. He is easy to use and such a time-saver!
</p>
<p>
I enjoy gadgets. Many turn out not to be worthwhile but two that I am
very pleased with are TiVo and Roomba - these are must-haves!

    <p>The Roomba is sure a must-have. It is really great on wall-to-wall carpet too.</p>
<p>If you consider buying one, beware of eBay -- the warranty is void if not bought from an approved dealer (online or store) as I unfortunately found with my first Roomba (the early models had many issues, mostly battery related, the new models such as the red or the discovery seem much more rebust.)</p>
