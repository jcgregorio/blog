effectively free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another awesome feature is that both services will provide SSL certificates; in
my case Firebase Hosting provides the cert for https://bitworking.org, and
Google Cloud Run provides the SSL cert for the subdomain where my instance of

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315–1317&quot;&gt;Great Famine of
1315-1317&lt;/a&gt; only
lasted two years, was no where close to the change in climate that we are
looking in the face right now, and it wiped out 10-25% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To provide some measure of relief, the future was mortgaged by slaughtering
the draft animals, eating the seed grain, abandoning children to fend for
themselves (see “Hansel and Gretel”) and, among old people, voluntarily
refusing food for the younger generation to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that frightens me most about climate change is that small
changes can have drastic affects and institutions can unravel much more
quickly than anyone imagines. My fear is that by the time things get bad
enough that we need to try things like geoengineering our institutions will
have fallen apart and we’ll be incapable of launching such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Gregorio</name></author><summary type="html">Great Famine</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Concentrated corporate power as a threat to democracy</title><link href="https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/concentrated-corporate-power-as-a-threat-to-democracy" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Concentrated corporate power as a threat to democracy" /><published>2019-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-05-04T10:55:41-04:00</updated><id>https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/concentrated-corporate-power-as-a-threat-to-democracy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/concentrated-corporate-power-as-a-threat-to-democracy">&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In terms of revenue collection, you wouldn’t want to just focus on the
 ordinary income rate, because people who are wealthy have a rounding error
 of ordinary income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see the U.S. do away with categories of income (income, earned
interest, capital gains, etc) and make it all just one bucket and tax that at
a progressive rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Gregorio</name></author><summary type="html">Bill Gates</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CEO Pay</title><link href="https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/ceo-pay" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CEO Pay" /><published>2019-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-05-04T10:55:41-04:00</updated><id>https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/ceo-pay</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bitworking.org/news/2019/03/ceo-pay">&lt;p&gt;I’ve said the Harvard MBA is the most second most damaging thing to happen to business in the last 40 years.
I might have to clarify that to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1db3jy3201d38/The-MBA-Myth-and-the-Cult-of-the-CEO&quot;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;myth&lt;/strong&gt; of the Harvard MBA is the second
most damaging thing to happen to business in the last 40 years&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We found no statistically significant alphas — despite testing every
possible school with a reasonable sample size. MBA programs simply do not
produce CEOs who are better at running companies, if performance is measured
by stock price return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if there is no evidence that stock returns are attributable to CEOs,
then what justification is there for their stratospheric pay? How much
longer will investors and boards be fooled by randomness and hollow
credentialism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the first most damaging thing to happen to business in the past 40 years? &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2017/10/25/stiglitz-vs-friedman.html&quot;&gt;The Chicago School of Economics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Gregorio</name></author><summary type="html">I’ve said the Harvard MBA is the most second most damaging thing to happen to business in the last 40 years.

&lt;p&gt;Look at poor Ken, so freaked out that everyone is talking about taxes.
Obviously a firm believer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics&quot;&gt;trickle-down economics&lt;/a&gt;, his entire screed boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically he refers to Bill Gates, who appears &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18220756/bill-gates-tax-rate-70-percent-marginal-modern-monetary-theory&quot;&gt;not to agree with Ken at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the full context it’s useful to watch the video from the beginning
where Historian Rutger Bregman schools Michael Dell on his ignorant comment
about a top marginal tax rate of 70%:&lt;/p&gt;

Read with caution, or skip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitworking.org/news/2019/01/a-thing-that-happened&quot;&gt;while describing my initial hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned an open question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What exactly my anus is supposed to be doing for those three months is a question I forget to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I know from the questions and comments I’ve received that many of you
are curious too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer turns out to be “nothing much” for most of the time, with
occassional bouts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb&quot;&gt;Phantom Limb&lt;/a&gt; sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the “phantom limb” in this case is my large intestines, which are no
longer hooked up to my rectum. The sensation they are missing is the pressure
that comes when stool builds up in the colon, which in turn triggers the
sensations of “needing to go”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one or two times a day I get the sensation of “needing to go”. I
logically know that’s an impossibility, but apparently my rectum is not swayed
by logic, so I had to look for alternative methods of getting the sensation to
go away. It turns out there is one way to get it to go away and that’s to go
and sit on the toilet as if I were having a bowl-movement. And I realize, as I
sit here, on the toilet, not having a bowl-movement, that what I’m really
doing in playing “make pretend” for my rectum. And it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if my rectum will be as grateful as my kids are for all the time I
spent playing “make pretend” with them?&lt;/p&gt;
