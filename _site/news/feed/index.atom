Read with caution, or skip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitworking.org/news/2019/01/a-thing-that-happened&quot;&gt;while describing my initial hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned an open question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What exactly my anus is supposed to be doing for those three months is a question I forget to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I know from the questions and comments I‚Äôve received that many of you
are curious too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer turns out to be ‚Äúnothing much‚Äù for most of the time, with
occassional bouts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb&quot;&gt;Phantom Limb&lt;/a&gt; sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the ‚Äúphantom limb‚Äù in this case is my large intestines, which are no
longer hooked up to my rectum. The sensation they are missing is the pressure
that comes when stool builds up in the colon, which in turn triggers the
sensations of ‚Äúneeding to go‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one or two times a day I get the sensation of ‚Äúneeding to go‚Äù. I
logically know that‚Äôs an impossibility, but apparently my rectum is not swayed
by logic, so I had to look for alternative methods of getting the sensation to
go away. It turns out there is one way to get it to go away and that‚Äôs to go
and sit on the toilet as if I were having a bowl-movement. And I realize, as I
sit here, on the toilet, not having a bowl-movement, that what I‚Äôm really
doing in playing ‚Äúmake pretend‚Äù for my rectum. And it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if my rectum will be as grateful as my kids are for all the time I
spent playing ‚Äúmake pretend‚Äù with them?&lt;/p&gt;

I am recoving slowly. As I‚Äôve gotten better I‚Äôve progressed through the three
stages of TV watching:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can‚Äôt watch TV, too much activity and sound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I could sit here and watch David Attenborough for days on end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I watch any more TV my brain is going to melt and flow out through my
ears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, what happened to cooking shows on TV? Remember when they used to just be
someone preparing a recipe? When did they become talk shows? I miss the days
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eK4umRMJlrs&quot;&gt;Justin Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve gotten better enough to actually cook dinner for the family, which is an
incredibly gratifying stage in my return to being a productive human being,
though it is quite a longer process than normal, as I‚Äôm still recovering. The
prep for dinner last night was little bouts of activity spread across three
hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean space in fridge for chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a nap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spatchcock the chicken and salt it, place in fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slice zucchini and onion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take another nap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it‚Äôs slow and steady progress every day.&lt;/p&gt;

while my wife still sleeps. The only context you need for what‚Äôs about to
happen next is that my intestines had been a little sore the previous two
days and that last year I found out that I had diverticulosis. The latter
found because when you turn 50 you get a free colonoscopy. I really don‚Äôt
think there is a more apt metaphor for turning 50 than a free colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;, the rest of this story contains references to urine, feces,
blood, needles, and any number of other unpleasant dinner table topics. If
you are squeamish, or would be unable to look me in the eye the next time we
meet, you should stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on the toilet when I get a huge flapping and stabbing pain in my
intestines. This is a pain that is so intense and otherworldly that I‚Äôm thrown
off the toilet onto my hands and knees. It is hard to describe this feeling,
but imagine taking a wooden children‚Äôs block, you know the ones, with the big
letters and numbers on them in bold colors? So take one of those, attach it to
the head of a 3/8‚Äù drill-bit, shove that up your ass, and then turn on the
drill. Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what it felt like. I‚Äôm able to crawl a few
feet before calling out to my wife, where she finds me naked in the fetal
position on the cold bathroom tile floor. She asks, and as I can start to
breath again as the pain descends, on a scale from 0 to 10, from a 10 down to
about a 6, I explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with getting me a pillow.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lying on the floor for awhile and having the pain subside down to about
a 4, I get dressed, and get a 2pm doctor‚Äôs appointment. The office says they
can and do want to see me soon given the severity of what might be going on,
so I schedule a 2pm appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never make that appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynne is out walking the dog, almost back to the house, when I call her,
‚ÄúForget the doctor‚Äôs appointment, we need to go to the ER, now!‚Äù My pain has
shot back up to an 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pain for next two hours will oscillate between a 4 and an 8. Yes, you heard
that correctly, the next two hours. It will take that long to get me though
the triaging process and into an ER bed and enough tests run that they start
to give me something for the pain. I do get the idea that the doctors don‚Äôt
want to mask any pain that might help with a diagnosis, but do you really
think that the difference between me howling incoherently and merely able to
speak and tell them my pain is a 6 is that sharp of a diagnostic tool?
Regardless, I spend the next two hours oscillating between a 4 and an 8, and
anything above a 7 requires chanting the ‚ÄúLitany of Pain‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Shit. Fuck. Damn.&quot;
&quot;Shit. Fuck. Damn.&quot;
&quot;Fuck. Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I promptly did, for an hour, in the ER waiting room lying across a bench
seat. Please note that I understand that your personal ‚ÄúLitany of Pain‚Äù may differ,
and may change based on the pain level, for example mine tends to peter out at
a 9 to just gurgling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CT scan comes back with ‚Äúinflamed diverticulum‚Äù and a surgeon appears to
explain that given my pain it‚Äôs probably ruptured and that she‚Äôd like to
operate, or we could wait awhile and see if antibiotics make a difference in
the pain. I‚Äôm not going to jump into any surgery, so I decide to wait, but the
description of what the actual surgery will entail really makes me uneasy. The
plan would be open me up, cut out the offending piece of colon, and route the
end of the now shorter colon into an ostomy. I had no idea the human body was
that flexible, ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs re-route your butt hole to somewhere in your
abdomen!‚Äù seems more like a Zoidberg surgery than an actual procedure, who
knew? Anyway, then the rest of the plan is to wait three months for everything
to heal, and do the reverse surgery, undoing the colonostomy and reconnecting
my colon to my anus. What exactly my anus is supposed to be doing for those
three months is a question I forget to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend the next 24 hours in the hospital with IV antibiotics as my
temperature, white blood cell count, and pain continue to rise. A new CT scan
confirms that I have a ruptured colon: I will not be avoiding surgery. In
fact, they are so alarmed that they take me straight from the CT to the
operating room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs talk about ‚ÄúVersed‚Äù, a drug that they give you before surgery so that
you don‚Äôt remember any of the horrors that surgery, or surgery prep, or coming
out of surgery entail. It does all that, but apparently it also pretty well
scrambles your brain for some time following the surgery. When I woke up in my
hospital room the doctor was there explaining my status, the surgery, what
they found, and next steps to my wife. Except that my brain was translating
their entire conversation into Kubernetes command line strings (essentially a
kind of programming language). And I‚Äôm there taking in as if was completely
normal, like I‚Äôm happy I got the surgery at such a cutting edge place that
they‚Äôre using Kubernetes to control their surgical procedures. It‚Äôs not until
days later in the hospital, in a fleeting instance of lucidity, that I realize
how fucking insane and nonsensical that sounds. So I begin going back over
the things I know and fact checking them. I know, for example, that they have
me up and walking right after surgery and that I take regular walks on that
hospital floor, and as I get better I might be able to go for a walk in the
outside exercise area, which is a small stone-lined plaza in Italy. Wait,
what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the full eight days I spent in the hospital are a little
fuzzy, and I might not be a reliable witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the eight days I had get to past certain milestones, such as peeing on my
own. I never realized how happy you could make a nurse by peeing, which
apparently comes in second place only to how happy you can make a nurse by
producing stool from your stoma. I‚Äôm pretty sure I was an infant the last time
that many people were excited by my poop production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am home recovering from colon surgery. It‚Äôs like having a new baby, all
the conversations are about pee, poop, and sleeping schedules, except in this
case, I‚Äôm the baby. Really it‚Äôs all about the gas. Every part of my now
shortened digestive tract is swollen and irritable, so everything produces
gas, and all gas produces discomfort. Which leads me to my three rules of
colon surgery recovery discomfort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs always gas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking fixes everything. (See #1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unless maybe you‚Äôre hungry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I walk, and I walk, and I walk. In the house though, because it has been
either too cold outside, or drenching rain. So I walk up and down the upstairs
hall, or loop-de-loops around the furniture downstairs, and I belch, and I
belch, and I belch. That‚Äôs apparently yet another thing that makes nurses
happy; I would be doing one of my regular walks in the hospital wing and let out
one of those deep, loud belches that start at your toes, and a cheer would
rise from the nurses station every time. Nurses are weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm just two days home from the hospital at this point, with another two weeks
of recovery at least before I can return to anything resembling a normal life,
except for the shadow of the reversal surgery hanging out there three months
from now. Thanks for reading this far, as I know that writing it has certainly
helped me process my adventure to date. Many thanks to family, friends, and
co-workers for all their support, it means a huge amount to me and Lynne. Oh
yeah, did I mention that Lynne had a sinus infection through all this, she‚Äôs
been an amazing trooper, my rock, and I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through without
her.&lt;/p&gt;
