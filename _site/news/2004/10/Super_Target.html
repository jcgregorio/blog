      <p>They just opened a new Super-Target less than two miles from my house. This is vastly more convenient than the old Not-So-Super-Target that's twenty minutes away. Now a Super-Target is just like a normal Target, but with the addition of a grocery store. I always thought the "Super" combo stores like Super Wal-Mart and Super-Target were a bit odd. What are the chances I want to buy groceries and say, a DVD player?</p>
<p>So I went to our brand new Super-Target with a short food list in hand, 
   to try it out. You know, to compare prices to our regular grocery store. 
   Just groceries.</p>
<p>I walked out of the store with my groceries.</p>
<p> And three t-shirts.</p>
<p> And a long-john top. </p>
<p> And five pairs of underwear.</p>
<p> And a spatula.</p>
<p>It felt weird to be in the check out line with all that stuff
   in the same cart. But what do I know? I have 3 new t-shirts,
   and they have my money. They must know what they're doing.</p>

    That's nothing.  I went to SuperTarget to buy groceries and came out with $273 worth of stuff, including a garage shelving unit, three bags of Halloween candy, a doormat, and a printer.  And I went back later that night and bought a DVD player!  I am not in any way making this up.

    Remember Gemco stores? It is the same concept, everything that is old is new again.

    Our ST just opend about 2 months ago and I practically live there!  I'm there almost every day for something.  The prices are pretty low..I've also found that the Target brand (generic) tastes better than the other <em>_</em>-Mart generic brands so I save even more!!!

    I am a Team Member of Target. I work at a Target Greatland in Missouri. Greatlands are big but they dont have groceries, anyway the first time i stepped into a SuperTarget i fell in love with it. Target is the best palce to shop and work. You can do all of your one stop shopping without spending an arm and a leg. Since i started working at Target over a year ago, i never once stepped a foot into Wal-Mart. There stores are so gross and they do not know how to treat there customers. Target really know how to treat there team members and GUESTS. Thats right i said guest, we want our customers to feel like at home when they are shopping so we call you guys our GUESTS. Now doesent that sound a whole better then customer. TARGET RULES!!!
