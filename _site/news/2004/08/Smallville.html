  Smallville</a>. Maybe it 
  was the rather obtuse name, or maybe it was the
  breathless ads that made it sound like just
  another teen-angst melodrama, but I never clued 
  in that it was about Clark Kent (Superman) during his
  teen years. The shooting is dark, Clark doesn't have all of 
  his powers yet, and weird stuff happens in the town.
  The two epsisodes I've seen are good
  and I'm looking forward to "catching up" on this show.

    <p>You've definitely missed out on one of the best shows on TV! Unlike most shows which take a few seasons to find their footing, it was great out of the gate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can catch up most of the way on DVD...</p>

    Yeah -- Smallville's a fun show... I've watched it since nearly the beginning and even as a non-comic geek I've really dug it.

    Smallville is a great series. I have all the episodes from season 1 through to the 10th episode in season 4. If u've been watching from the begining it's really cool coz back then u were always wondering what new powers would clark gain with each episode. and then there is the flying. still clark does not have that ability. i guess when he is able to that will be the end of smallville and the begining of Super Man as everyone knows him!
