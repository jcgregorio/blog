I look back at the first web apps I ever put together 
  and feel a deep sense of shame. I knew so little about HTTP and HTML
  that I made quite a few bad decisions. Luckily these were deployed behind
  firewalls in the early days of the web when intranets were a buzzword
  and not standard practice. 
   I've learned a lot since then. Apparently
  if I wanted to stay in the stone age of web development I should have
  taken a job at Microsoft.
[Full-Disclosure] MS web designers -- "What Security Initiative?" 
[via Simon Fell]
Not So Stone Age Standards Improved
Meanwhile it looks like Ian Hickson and friends have been
   busy and launched the 
   Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group. 
   What Working Group? Heh, at least they haven't lost
   their sense of humor. They have setup shop outside the W3C after 
   being shot 
   down at a recent meeting. I wish them the best of luck on
   moving Web Forms 2.0 and their other specifications forward.
   I am not surprised to see this happening and I dearly hope that
   this serves as a bit of a wake up call to the leadership at the 
   W3C.

Tools
rfcdiff is tool 
  to compare two versions of an internet-draft, and as output produce 
  a diff in one of several formats, including a side-by-side HTML diff.
  It also appears to be written entirely in bash.
  This is something I plan on applying to the AtomAPI drafts, which by 
  the way I now have help with.
Help
Robert Sayre is now a 
  co-editor for the AtomAPI, which is extremely cool.

Defacto
Joel Spolsky's latest article 
   How Microsoft Lost the API War
   has some interesting insights into the politics and decision making
   behind the doors at Redmond. I have always been amazed that
   Microsoft saw the browser as competition for Windows as 
   early as it did. It is not often that an entrenced company 
   even sees a disruptive technology as a threat at all, never
   mind when it is still in its nascent stages. It also points
   out the futility of Microsoft's attempts to hold the web at bay,
   besides legislating the competition out of existence there really 
   isn't a good way for a company to fight a disruptive technology.

Circular
And just to close the loop and end up almost back at the beginning
   Joel provides his list of things he wants to see the WHAT Working Group working on.
