      <p>In the past I've talked about my experience 
  with <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/TI_Code_Composer_Studio__product_quality__and_Tech_Support">TI and their support for their DSPs</a>. 
  Given that experience I am now
  looking at <a href="http://www.analog.com">Analog Devices</a> and their <a href="http://www.analog.com/processors/processors/blackfin/index.html">
  Blackfin</a> line of DSPs.</p>

  <p>Compared to the TI part this has turned out to be a breath of fresh air.
   The Analog folks look like they've put a lot of effort into thinking about,
   and talking to, their customers and how they use DSPs, and that's reflected
   in their newest line of DSPs.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>DIO</dt>
<dd><p>One of the biggest differences is the number of generic digital I/Os
  that the Analog DSPs provide. The Blackfins typically come with 16 
  digital I/O lines, which is quite a bit more than you will
  usually find on a DSP, and these I/Os are truly general purpose,
  usable as inputs and outputs, aggregated as 10, 12, 14 or 16 bit
  input or output port suitable for interfacing to an ADC or DAC, and 
  oh by the way, if they're configured as inputs they can each be 
  setup to trigger interrupts.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important. If you are using DSP you probably want to
   <em>control</em> something based on that signal. Now there are exceptions,
   for example the digital processing for an MP3 player would just be from memory 
   out to a DAC that fed the headphones, so in theory you only need a 
   data bus interface and no DIOs. But that's theory and doesn't match up
   well with reality. The reality is that the MP3 Player has a user interface
   with buttons and knobs and <em>something</em> has to handle that 
   user input. Now the traditional thinking is that you have two processors, 
   one DSP for the signal processing, and a second less powerful processor
   for handling everything else. DSPs have become
   more powerful and there are more spare cycles. That is, the DSP has more than
   enough power to handle the signal processing with some to spare. Those
   spare cycles can be applied toward the <em>everything else</em> processing,
   unless of course you don't have the DIOs. </p>
<p>DIOs on the DSP are important because in a good design they may actually help 
   displace another processor which reduces cost, energy requirements,
   heat, and the number of development platforms you need to maintain.
  </p>
</dd>
<dt>Algebraic notation</dt>
<dd><p>The assembler for the Blackfin uses algebraic notation as opposed to
   a more traditional assembler notation. For example, to set the value of 
   a register R0 to 12 you use:</p>
<pre><code>R0 = 12;</code></pre>
<p>Now compare this to the more traditional assembler:</p>
<pre><code>MOV A0, 12;</code></pre>
<p>Which just feels like a language designed by a crack addled Yoda.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Write One To Set</dt>
<dd><p>This bit is absolutely brilliant. One of things you do all the time
  in embedded firmware is set bits. Or clear bits. Almost all of the 
  peripherals on modern CPUs are memory mapped which means that 
  you read and write to memory addresses to control their behavior.
  The problem is that a bunch of bits that control different aspects
  of the peripheral are all packed into the same word, and if you want
  to change something you read the word out into a register, flip the 
  bits you want changed, then write the value back into the memory 
  mapped register. That's a minimum of three operations, and you can
  end up spending a lot of time flipping 
  bits in memory mapped registers.</p>
<pre><code>MOV A0, B0[X+23];
AND A0, 0x0080, A0;
MOV B0[X+23], A0;</code></pre>
<p>I don't know where Analog came up with this, if it's even original to them
  or they borrowed it from someone else, but many of the registers 
 are W1S (write-1-to-set) or W1C (write-1-to-clear). That is, writing a value
  into a W1S register will set the bits where ever there is a 1 in the value
  written, the rest of the bits remain unchanged. Similarly for W1C, you write
  1's where you want the bits cleared, the remaining bits remain unchanged.
  Analog combines these, so that a single register may actually have multiple
  memory mapped areas, a W1C register, a W1S register, and a normal register.
  This makes for dramatic code reduction. For example, the above code which
  sets bit 7 of a memory mapped register becomes a single instruction
  if the register is W1S:
</p>
<pre><code>MOV 0x0080, B0[X+23];</code></pre>
<p>That's 1/3 of the code size, and also 3 times faster to execute.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Circular Buffers</dt>
<dd><p>Another common task in signal processing is handling buffers, 
   and those are commonly circular buffers. The Blackfin has native support
   for such constructs, where you setup 2 registers to define the beginning
   and length of a circular buffer, and then use a third register as
   an index into the buffer. The CPU takes care of keeping the 
   index register on track, you just keep on incrementing and it folds
   back down to the beginning of the buffer automagically. This 
   increases the speed of your loops since you don't need to check 
   for overflow everytime through.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>These are just some of the advantages of the new Blackfin chips.
  I've just started exploring  but it appears Analog has done
  a really good job listening to their customers and it shows
  in their products.</p>
<p>Oh, and that level of quality seems to 
  extend across the company, a quick note to webmaster@analog.com
  got a personal answer in about 12 hours, and the one documentation
  bug I reported got answered and closed out in a day.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote"><p>single instruction if the register is W1S:</p>
<p>MOV 0x0080, B0[X+23];</p></blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't this be (to be consistent w/ the "algebraic notation")?:<br />
  B0[X+23] = 0x0080</p>
