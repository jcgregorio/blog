      <p>Day 9 was pretty uneventful, Lynne, Caden and I spent some time
in the morning shopping with Mark, Moya and Andie.
The afternoon was filled with paperwork and the rest of the 
day was spent packing for our travelling to Guangzhou
the next day.
</p>

  <p>
Part of our shopping was to buy a new large suitcase. We didn't
really need it for this leg of the trip but we plan
on doing a lot of shopping in Guangzhou, enough that
we know we'll need a whole extra suitcase for everything
we are going to purchase.
</p>
<p>
The paperwork took over two hours to complete, not that
it bothered me much as Lynne took care of it while
Caden and I had together time. One of the things we
did together was get more pictures. Here is a shot of
the building I was talking about the other day, where
a shop has been setup on the ground floor and the building
isn't even complete.
</p>
<img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/unfinished_store.jpg" alt="Store and noodleshop setup in a building still under construction" title="There are actually two shops, one for equipment, the other is a noodle shop." />
<p>
I also got some pictures of what our group referred to 
as "the big dig" next to the Marriott. It is a large 
excavation for a basement, one of the three new highrises
being constructed in the front of the Marriott. The 
culture here is definitely not as safety conscious
as it is in the US. The pictures I took here are from the 
driveway of the Marriott. The only thing that separated me from 
a 50 foot fall to the bottom of the pit
was a thin landscaped area. No fence. No barriers. Nothing.
</p>
<img class="framed" src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/big_dig.jpg" alt="Large excavation for the basement of a highrise." title="The big dig." />
<p>
The paperwork that needed to be done is much longer 
and more complex than anything we've had to fill out
so far. That's because it is all for the American 
government and not for the Chinese government. Over the next
4 days we will complete all the steps we need to 
adopt Caden in the US.
</p>
<h3 id="day10">Day 10</h3>
<p>
After packing we turned in early, got up early and were on the
bus to the Chongqing airport by 9AM. A one and a half hour flight
landed us in Guangzhou and a 20 minute bus ride got us to the
White Swan Hotel. The White Swan is a 5 star hotel that is a favorite
of adoption agencies to put up their clients because it is so
nice and it is conveniently located to the services we need. The
American consulate is literally a 5 minute walk down the street.
Now we were fortunately warned from others that had gone before
us that if you stayed at the Chongqing Marriott then not to 
expect too much when you go to the White Swan. They were
right. I am quite honestly not that impressed. They messed up
our room assignment, first giving us a room on the 11th floor
then retracting it, saying the room wasn't ready, then after waiting
they gave us a room on the 15th floor, but it too wasn't cleaned
so they gave us the information, but refused to give us the keys
until the room was done. Wendy, one of our agency's representatives
out of New York was kind enough to let us use her room on the 
same floor until ours was cleaned. They assured us that they 
would get us from Wendy's room and give us the keys as soon
as it was done. Well, they didn't and 20 minutes later
we checked on things to find that the room was done, but our
keys were not available, and they'd forgotten to set up 
a crib in the room. They eventually got the crib set up and
the keys to us, but all-in-all it was a pretty shabby 
introduction to the hotel. Oh, and the rooms are smaller, the
beds are smaller, the bathroom is absolutely cramped with no 
counter or drawer space. In general the staff have been 
professional, but they verge on snooty and are nowhere 
near as nice as the staff at the Chongqing Marriott.
</p>
<p>
The entire feel of the area is very different from Chongqing.
The air is much cleaner and the area surrounding
the White Swan is almost alien, as it is all 
European styled buildings, something to do 
with Britian and France and the Opium Wars. We'll go 
into that more tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
We did a little exploring, mostly to get some 
bottled water and Coca-Cola, and to find the local
laundry. 
</p>
<h3 id="water">Water</h3>
<p>
Water has been constantly on our minds during this 
trip because none of the tap water is potable. As 
a matter of fact it has been various shades of brown
and tan over the last few days. Given that we don't in 
anyway want to ingest the water we go through a lot
of bottled water. It also means that we have been washing 
all of Caden's bottles and bowls with bottled water too.
You never realize how much water you use washing dishes
until you're pouring that water out of a bottle and 
not from a tap. The water restriction means that at every hotel
we have been hanging a towel over the tap to remind ourselves
not to use it, even for things like rinsing your mouth
after brushing your teeth, or for rinsing your tooth
brush off afterwards. Bottled water for <strong>everything</strong>.
Luckly we can pick it up at a reasonable price, a two liter bottle
runs only about 70 cents.
