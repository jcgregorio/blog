  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>This afternoon I went for a short walk 
    walk in the area immediately around the 
    Marriott. I looped through the 'pedestrian mall'
    which is a shipping area where the streets have been
    closed to cars, and the local flower market.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/tree_lined_street.jpg" class="framed" alt="A crowded sidewalk" title="The tree leaves are really that grayish-green from the grime." />
  
<p>This Zhonghua Road, a busy shop lined road on the way to the
    pedestrian mall. There are a mass of shops along these roads, some
    no more than 5 feet wide, selling everything from fine suits,
    to noodles, to shoes. Some of the clothing and shoe shops
    have their production setup right on the sidewalk, ancient looking
    sewing machines running all day long. It might look like a trick of 
    the light but the leaves really are that dull grayish-green color.
    The coal fired smoke and fog combine to produce a heavy smog that
    rains down a fine soot over everything in the city.
</p>
<p>There aren't many private vehicles on the roads, mostly 
  buses and taxi cabs. This is actually a pretty rare shot with 
  the street completely empty. The careful art of crossing the street as a 
  pedestrian, well, I'll leave the description of that
  for anther day.</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/old_alley.jpg" class="framed" alt="An alley way." title="Cranes, cranes and more cranes." />
<p>The alley way above is a nice study in contrasts. The smaller buildings 
    nestled back in the alley are much shorter and older than the ones
    near the front of the building. In the back you can see two high-rises
    in the mist. Both buildings are incomplete, the one on the left you
    can see the ever present crane on top.</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/porter.jpg" class="framed" alt="Busy street with a porter" title="A Pole Army member" />
<p>The man on the right hand side of the above picture with the long bamboo 
    pole in his hands is a member of what the locals call the "Pole Army".
    Chongqing is a very mountainous region and bikes are not much use here, instead
    there are droves of men with poles that work as porters that carry items
    around the city. I've seen them carrying some pretty heavy loads. In the center
    of the picture is one of the clothing shops with the sewing machines set out
    on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>This brings out a recurrent theme I've seen across the whole trip
    into China. Whatever problem we would solve with technology in 
    the US, the Chinese solve with people, and where we would use
    people to do a job in China they would use <strong>more</strong>
    people. Where we would use trucks, they have porters. 
    Where we would use backhoes, they use laborers.
    Another example, in every grocery store and department store
    we have been in from Beijing to Chongqing, they are staffed with
    one person per aisle. Yes, you read that correctly, one person
    per aisle. We have yet to eat in a sit-down restaurant 
    where the patrons outnumbered
    the staff. 
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/mcdonalds.jpg" class="framed" alt="McDonalds sign on a busy street" title="I wish I had the luxury and could 'brave' the noodles. They looked real good." />
<p>
    What good is a city without a McDonalds? How about 60 of them in Chongqing alone.
    There are two within walking distance of our hotel. This picture is 
    taken on the pedestrian mall, with the McDonalds and a noodle shop
    on the left. The large mass of people in the middle of the picture
    are sitting on the benches eating noodles. Huge steaming mounds of 
    delicious smelling noodles served in thin plastic bowls and eaten with
    the same disposable wooden chopsticks you get at Chinese restaurants 
    in the US.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/flower_market_entrance.jpg" class="framed" alt="entrance to the flower market" title="" />
<p>Here is the flower market across the street from the hotel. I bought Lynne
    a half-dozen roses here on my way back. It was my first time haggling
    and I didn't do a very good job, but I got her the half-dozen (actually 7 roses)
    for 10 Yuan or $1.25US. One of the nicest things about being in China is that
    I am getting used to the prices and going back to the US is going to 
    be difficult, and we haven't even gotten to do a lot of shopping outside
    of department stores where there isn't any haggling. 
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/down_flower_market.jpg" class="framed" alt="open air flower market" title="" />
<p>The market is more like an alley, with vendors selling everything from 
    individual flowers, to huge arrangements, to bonsai trees, to gardening supplies.
    The alleys winds through the block and turns right and as turns it trasitions from
    flowers to food staples and cooked food. The above picture is a shot looking back
    down the alley towards the entrance. Each of the rooves on the left is a different
    shop selling different tools, produce or plants. For those of you with 
    good connections I shot a short video (440KB) of the 
    <a href="http://bitworking.org/images/China/flower-market-long.wmv">pedestrian traffic flowing into
        the entrance of the flower market
    </a>. This is a pretty good representation of the pedestrian traffic and noise levels
    that are continuous throughout the city.
    It is a WMV file that I've tested
    in both Windows Media Player and Real Player. <del>I can provide the original 
    AVI file to anyone that wants to convert it into different formats, for which I would
    be eternally grateful.</del> </p><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://ralf.alfray.com/">Ralf</a>
    for converting the flower street video into 
    <a href="http://bitworking.org/images/China/FlowerMarket.divx">divx</a>, 
    <a href="http://bitworking.org/images/China/FlowerMarket.mov">quicktime</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://bitworking.org/images/China/FlowerMarket.mp4">mp4</a>!</p>

<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/sold.jpg" class="framed" alt="Flower vendor wrapping up a sale." title="They are very, very fragrant flowers." />
<p>This final shot is about half-way up the alley, a vendor is wrapping up
    a sale to the people standing in front of him. Behind him wends
    another alley, orthogonal to the current one that contains more
    plants and trees for sale. There aren't many flowers
    on the branches he's sold but they have a <strong>very</strong> strong scent. Speaking
    of scent, that's one of the things about China that I can't blog. There are wonderful scents
    like the flower market above, and the great smells of food wafting out of some of the
    stalls. On the other hand there are some pretty awful stenches, some that
    are nauseatingly familiar, others that of unknown origin and are completely beyond any previous
    experience.
