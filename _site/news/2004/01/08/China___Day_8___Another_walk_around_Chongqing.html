      <p>Another day and another walk around Chongqing.
    This time Caden and Lynne accompanied me and 
    Lynne took the pictures.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/porter.jpg" class="framed" alt="Porter on a crowded street" title="A typical load for a porter." />

  <p>Whenever we go out with Caden she gets put in the 
    sling, which does several things. The first thing it does
    is save my back. The second thing the sling does is 
    cover most of Caden, with a hat only her eyes are
    visible outside of the sling if she's awake, and she
    is completely hidden if she falls asleep. The reason
    you want to keep her hidden is to avoid the "clothing
    police". The "clothing police", as we call them, are 
    well meaning older chinese women that will run up to
    you and cover any exposed part of a child and admonish you
    to keep them covered. The first time we went out Caden had the lower
    part of her legs exposed and three times on the walk we had
    ladies approach and pull her pant legs down further over
    her socks. The "clothing police" are only bested by the 
    "thumb police". Caden sucks her thumb which is apparently 
    a big no-no in China and complete strangers have no 
    problem walking up to her and yanking her thumb from her
    mouth while admonishing us. Now you could try to explain that
    we just adopted her and that this is a particularly stressful
    time for her and we'll deal with the thumb sucking at a later
    date, but when you only speak english and they only speak
    Mandarin, well, you just keep the thumb hidden.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/slung.jpg" class="framed" alt="Caden in the sling." title="Back off." />
<p>Being so deep in China anybody who isn't non-Asian is a
    rare sight and Lynne and I are constantly stared at
    just for our looks alone, but the attention is much greater
    when were out with Caden. Lots of pleasant stares and smiles
    as we walk along, but if we stop, a crowd will gather. This
    has an interesting dynamic as many people try out their
    English on us and if one person 'makes contact', that is
    they say something we understand, they instantly get
    promoted to 'local translator' and everyone around
    them starts peppering <em>them</em> with questions 
    to ask us. News that we are Americans and that we just adopted
    Caden is always greeted with huge smiles and great
    appreciation. Here I am getting slightly mobbed on
    the pedestrian mall. 
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/mobbed.jpg" class="framed" alt="A crowd gathers around me and Caden" title="Everyone insists on touching her cheeks." />
<p>These two girls were at first shy, but after asking about
    Caden and getting a couple pictures of themselves taken they
    started to ham it up.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/girls.jpg" class="framed" alt="Two children." title="Bunny ears!" />
<p>One of the strangest sights in both Beijing and Chongqing has been
    the sight of decidedly non-Asian mannequins. And it doesn't just
    end with the mannequins, a good portion of the advertising
    is populated with decidedly European looking models. 
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/mannequins.jpg" class="framed" alt="Mannequins" title="I haven't seen a single asian mannequin." />
<p>Did I mention that there's a lot of people here.</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/crowd.jpg" class="framed" alt="A crowd" title="This is
    in the middle of a weekday." />
<p>One of the things I won't be able to get across, no matter
    how many pictures or videos I take, is the amazing 
    contrasts that you can find in Chongqing. The
    brand new building in the front is built right up to,
    and includes a bit of a facade for, the aging apartment
    building behind it. Everywhere you see these contrasts
    and amazing changes. There is a high-rise across
    the street from the hotel that is under construction.
    In the uncompleted ground floor of the building people 
    have already setup a noodle shop. From our 
    hotel window I can count 17 cranes on 
    15 high-rises currently under construction.
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/contrast_cropped.jpg" class="framed" alt="Two buildings" title="Only a few of the apartments has air conditioning." />
<p>Even in the midst of the all the construction and modernity
    there are reminders that this is an ancient land and culture.
    Less than half a block from our hotel is this drug-store
    which is six feet wide it is a single aisle twenty feet long. 
</p>
<img src="http://bitworking.org/images/China/08/drug_store.jpg" class="framed" alt="Drug store" title="Given my lack of Mandarin I won't be trying anything here" />
<p>I hope you're all enjoying the photos. Once I get back to the US
    I need to learn some more about photography in general
    and digital photograpy in particular. For example, here is
    my current 'system' for handling digital photos.</p>
<ol>
<li>Load photo into Paint Shop Pro.</li>
<li>Crop and resize.</li>
<li>Press "One step photo fix..."</li>
<li>If it doesn't look good then choose another photo.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Joe - it's been really interesting reading about your trip. I can totally relate to some of your "Lost in Translation" moments, as my wife is Chinese (I am not) and we occasionally visit Taiwan. </p>
<p>Congratulations on the adoption!</p>
