<p><a href='http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/""'>Python 2.5 has been released</a>. 
   I am now in the process of testing my libraries to 
   make sure nothing has broken. So far <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/">httplib2</a>
   checks out fine. The one odd part is that the unit tests run two to three times
   faster under 2.5 than they did under 2.4. I know performance was 
   one of the things <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/highlights/">highlighted in 2.5</a>, 
   but twice as fast? That's impressive.
   I plan on testing it out on some other machines just to be sure. 
   And don't go quoting me on the speed increase, the last thing I need
   is the unit tests for <code>httplib2</code> becoming some sort of 
   unofficial benchmark.
