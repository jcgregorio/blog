<p>Found via Marks b-links, is <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/web-forms-2">Web Forms 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>Now I've gone on endlessly about the complexity
   and short-comings of XForms:

<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/HTTP_and_HTML">HTTP and HTML</a>,
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/46">Sans DELETE</a>, and

<p><a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/web-forms-2">
   Web Forms 2.0</a>, edited
   by Opera's own Ian Hickson, is a breath of fresh air.
   Instead of trying to completely revolutionize 
   HTML forms, it takes an incremental approach, building
   on an already stable base, fixing common problems
   (like the fact that forms can only do GET and POST,
    which in my opinion is a bug of the HTML specifications),
   and adding new features in a way that is backward compatible 
   that strike a good 80/20 balance (a new mime-type for form
   submission of application/x-www-form+xml).</p>

  
<p>It starts with this completely sensible set of requirements
   that are <strong>drawn from requests of real people trying to
   get a job done</strong>.

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility (where possible).

   </li><li>Ease of authoring for authors with limited knowledge about XML, data
    models, etc, but familiar with commonly used languages such as HTML and
    ECMAScript.

   </li><li>Basic data typing, providing new controls for commonly used types, so
    that authors do not need to repeatedly design complicated widgets such as
    calendars.

   </li><li>Simpler validation on the client side (while recognizing that server
    side validation will still be required), with declarative solutions for
    the common case but strong DOM support so that less common cases can
    easily be handled using scripting.

   </li><li>Dynamically adding more fields (repeating structures) on the client
    side without scripting.

   </li><li>XML submission (although not necessarily structured XML submission).

   </li><li>The ability to initialize forms from external data sources, so that
    authors do not have to dynamically rewrite the form content itself to
    prefill forms, but can instead use static pages with scripts that
    dynamically generate only the data part.
  </li></ul></blockquote>
</p><p>This is absolutely great work that I would like to point
   out did not come from the W3C.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just to make it clear, I don't <em> have it out </em>
   for anyone involved in XForms. In particular I would like to point out
   that while I pan XForms pretty hard, one of the editors for XForms
   is <a href="http://dubinko.info/">Micah Dubinko</a> who has also 
   authored <a href="http://dubinko.info/writing/skunklink/">SkunkLink</a>, another
   fine piece of work that again comes from <em>outside</em> the W3C.</p>
