  <p>It's time to hit the road again. This November I will be 
  <a href="http://2005.xmlconference.org/program/tuesday#20">speaking on the Atom Publishing Protocol</a> at 
  <a href="http://2005.xmlconference.org/">XML 2005</a>
  which is being held in Atlanta, GA. If you <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/XML_2004_Review">remember last year
  I presented at XML 2004</a> and was initially skeptical
  but in the end really enjoyed myself and I have been eagerly awaiting
  this years conference. The good news is that this year the conference
  <b>isn't</b> being held in Washington, DC which should make it less
  expensive to attend at least as far as hotel and food are concerned.
  Hope to see you there.</p>
