  <p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/19/Who">Tim Bray</a> follows up with some
information on his recent slashdotting of his
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/16/XML-Prog">XML Is Too Hard for
Programmers</a>. He got about 30,000 hits from that
article which prominently linked to my 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/40">Regex-able Xml</a> item.
I picked up about 3,000 hits from click-throughs during 
his Slashdotting. Interestingly enough we can trace it one level
deeper, as it appears that 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1285.html">Sam Ruby</a> got 300 hits on an essay 
of his that I linked to at the end of Regex-able XML.</p>
