    After avoiding <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">JSON</a> 
    for a long time I am finally getting around to looking at it.
    The reason I'm <i>just now</i> looking is that the specification is now available
    as an informational RFC without the funky license that plauged the
    original. 
    <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/12/16/json">Yes, licensing matters.</a>
</p>

  
<p>
    The first thing you notice when you look at JSON is the simplicity. It certainly 
    hits its target as a "lightweight data-interchange format". 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
        JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the
        serialization of structured data.  It is derived from the object
        literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming
        Language Standard, Third Edition [ECMA].
        </p>
<p>
        JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans,
        and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
    And I was happy to see a clear and simple character encoding story for JSON, which
    is Unicode in one of UTF-8, UTF-16 (BE or LE), or UTF-32 (BE or LE), all of which 
    is detectable by looking at the first four octets.
    <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html">Contrast this with XML</a>.
</p>
<h3>The XML we wanted</h3>
<p>
    It appears that JSON is the XML that many people wanted. 
    For proof of that just look at  
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-datatypes">XML Schema</a>.

    But JSON is a data structure serialization, as opposed to 
    the markup language that is XML, and could
    probably do just fine with a schema language, which 
    could define some more data types based on
    the primitives that are present. For example, there is no native JSON datatype
    for a date/time, and that's probably not something
    you want to define on an application by application basis.
</p>
<p>
    All of this looks good except for the extensibility
    story which 
    <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/01/24/json">
        Mark Nottingham has already covered</a>.
    With no baked in extensibility story you will 
    end up with a real world experiment in the viability 
    of 'short names'. On the other hand JSON qnames will
    work like most people (mistakenly) expect them to work
    in XML. You might end up seeing:

<p>There are, of course, plenty of opinions on whether
    a system of 'short name' disambiguation can reliably 
    prevent conflicts and still be fair:

<li><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Ocean_boiling_in_the_age_of_microformats">Ocean boiling in the age of microformats</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea how this 'short name' experiment will end
for either JSON or Microformats, but it certainly
bears careful watching.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use">When to use XML vs JSON?</h3>
<p>JSON isn't XML and fills a gap that 
    XML was being stretched to fill. The strengths
    and weaknesses of the formats need to be taken into
    consideration when deciding which to use. If you are
    transporting <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Document_Centric">documents</a> or are aiming for a wide
    range of extensibility then you should be using XML.
    If you have control over both ends of the wire, for example, talking 
    to your own web server from HTML pages served from that same server, then 
    you should be using JSON. Everything in between will require 
    some judgement.
</p>
<p>Of course, old habits die hard and one of the first
    specs that uses JSON is <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a>.
</p>
<p>But you can still use JSON RESTfully, right?</p>
<p>Yes you can ...</p>
