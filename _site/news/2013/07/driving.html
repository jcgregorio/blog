  <p> This NYTime article on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/sunday-review/the-end-of-car-culture.html">The End of Car Culture</a>
  very mich rings true for me, none of our kids look forward to having
  a car like we did. It felt like we had to <em>push </em>the oldest one to
  get his learners permit. Made even odder by the fact that we don&#39;t live
  anywhere near any sort of useful public transportation.
