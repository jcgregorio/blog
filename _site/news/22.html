  <p>I have been doing a lot of XML manipulation
in the implementation of <a href="http://wellformedweb.org">RESTLog</a> 
recently and come to really despise the DOM. In the best of situations
it leads to akward and verbose code, in the worst of times.. well 
we won't use those words in a public place...</p>
<p>A pretty good clue that an API is fundamentally broken is you keep
re-creating the missing pieces or obvious patches from platform
to platform. This I have already done in C# and I am now finding myself
doing it again in Python. A function to get the raw text of an element as a single
string, function to set the raw text of an element, function to robustly
add a namespaced element and it's value to a document overwriting an 
existing element if it is already there, etc. The list could go on
but you get the idea. It stinks and I need something better. </p>
<p>For example, what is the shortest piece of code you can write
to add a namespaced element to a document through a DOM API? To
be even more specific, how much code does it take to add the element:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;dc:date&gt;2003-01-27T22:52:04-05:00&lt;/dc:date&gt;</code></pre>
<p>as a child element to 'item' in this document, <ins title="Added after Dare posted his
example and I realized my explaination was weak." datetime="2003-01-28T13:56:00-05:00">
but avoid adding a duplicate dc:date if one already exists, instead replacing the 'dc:date'
elements contents with the new value.</ins></p>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;item&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;A sunny day&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;link&gt;http://example.com&lt;/link&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;Insert witty prose here.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What I want is an API that would make it easy, for example:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>insertElement(
  namespaces={"dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"}, 
  path="item/dc:date", 
  value="2003-01-27T22:52:04-05:00", 
  unique=True)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://tima.mplode.com">Timothy Appnel</a> sent me a link to
   Paul Prescod's <a href="http://www.prescod.net/python/pulldom.html">
   explaination of PullDOM</a> as implemented in Python, which is cool.
   I like pull based parsers for reading XML, in fact I use the pull based
   parser in the .Net Framework when building the RSS parser for Aggie.</p>
<p>Erick Herring sent me a link to <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org">Elliotte Rusty Harold's</a>
<a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a>. In the documentation for this
   API is also a presentation entitled, <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/whatswrong/">"What's Wrong with XML APIs (and how to fix them)"</a>.
   It is a good overview of the different APIs available and their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Second Update:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/1/28/125859/197">Dare Obasanjo</a> 
  has kindly offered up a two line solution
  in C#. There are however two problems. The first is my fault since I wasn't very clear
  about the behaviour I wanted if a 'dc:date' element was already present. I have added
  more verbage to the description to clarify that if 'dc:date' already exists
  then the item's content should be replaced with the new content.</p>
<p>The second problem with Dare's example is that it's not valid DOM. The
  InnerXml property isn't a part of the DOM. Even if you were to use the
  DOM attribute 'nodeValue' the DOM doesn't allow you
  to set 'nodeValue' when node is of type Element. I think it's great that 
  Microsoft has added useful extensions to the DOM. My point is that they
  <strong>had</strong> to add them to make working with XML tolerable.</p>
