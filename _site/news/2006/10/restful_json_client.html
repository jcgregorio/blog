As promised, <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/jep/cookbook/main.cgi/cookbook/">
here is the RESTful JSON client I referred to
previously</a>. I am willing to bet you weren't expecting JavaScript.
</p>

  
<p><b>Note:</b> this has only been tested in FireFox 1.5 on Ubuntu, your mileage
may vary. Here is a screenshot to refer to if the page doesn't work
for you.</p>
<p><img src="http://bitworking.org/images/2006/10/jep-cookbook.png" /></p>
<p>
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/jep/cookbook/static/list.js.html">Here is a pretty printed version of the JavaScript
</a>,
in case you haven't pull down the 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/jep/cookbook/">source code for yourself
via bzr</a>.
This code only relies on
one external library, <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> for the JSON serializer.
Yes, that's heavyweight for just one small
bit of functionality, but <a href="http://www.json.org/js.html">the alternative has
copyright issues</a> we don't need to rehash here again.
</p>
<p>
As for the operation of the application, there are five 
links, click on them and the recipe shows up in the
form elements below. From there you can update or 
delete the recipe, or type in a new recipe and press
"Create" to have it added to the list. All of this happens
via calls to the JSON Server implementation
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/restful_json_server">I described previously</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what, what have I done here, besides re-invent GMail, poorly?
While the interface is nothing special AJAX-wise it is 
unique is that the back end protocol is RESTful and not RPC.
Admittedly at this point it is a pretty
naive implementation and there are basic
optimizations that we can do now that we have a
RESTful interface, for example, implementing
ETags and gzip, which I will do a in a future
article.
</p>
<p>
One of the things I learned from doing this implementation
was the feedback it provided into the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/restful_json">
original idea
for the protocol that I had outlined before</a>.
One of the things that seems akward is that
the interaction with the server is pretty chatty regardless
of the size of the member entry representations.
One of the first things that should change is that 
in the case of small payloads, like our
recipe, it may make sense to include the 
entity in the collection document. So instead of 
just supplying:
</p>
<pre><code>
{
  "members": [
    {"href": "1"}, 
    {"href": "2"}, 
    {"href": "3"}, 
    {"href": "4"}
    ], 
  "next": null
}
</code></pre>
<p>
We could optionally include the actual member representation
via an "entity" name/value pair.
</p>
<pre><code>
{
  "members": [
    {"href": "1",
<b>     "entity", {
        "instructions": "First, get a trout...", 
        "id": 1, 
        "title": "Trout on a stick"
        }</b>
    }, 
    ...
  ], 
  "next": null
}
</code></pre>
<p>
That could help reduce the number of 
requests to member resources
when populating a list, like we do when the cookbook
page starts. 
</p>
<p>
But we could even take that optimization
one step further, because we really should
do a GET every time the user clicks on a link to
make sure the latest version of the recipe is 
presented. Having the entity in the collection
document doesn't really give us anything in that
case since we don't know if the verson on the client
is stale. One thing we could do is include
the ETag for each member resource in the 
collection document. That would allow us to
do a conditional GET on the member the first
time the user clicked on the link and if the
member was unchanged we would get a 304 Not Modified 
response and no entity body, which 
is potentially much fast than doing a non-conditional
GET.
</p>
<p>
Let's revise our collection document one more
time to reflect those ideas:
</p>
<pre><code>
{
  "members": [
    {"href": "1",
<b>     "etag":"0hf0239hf2hf9fds09sadfo90ua093j", </b>
     "entity", {
        "instructions": "First, get a trout...", 
        "id": 1, 
        "title": "Trout on a stick"
        } 
    }, 
    ...
  ], 
  "next": null
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that both "etag" and "entity" should be optional.
</p>
<p>This is looking pretty good, the initial idea was 
easy to implement on both the client and the server
and the first implementations have provided some good 
feedback on the structure of the protcol. I think I ought to
say a bit more on where I think this overlaps with the 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>
and also maybe write up the protocol more
formally, all of which I will do in future entries.
</p>
