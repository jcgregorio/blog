    I can't see how they could make Acrobat that bad. It takes about a minute or even longer to load a pdf from a website. I have to download the pdf instead before I can see it with acrobat reader. They have to do something about it.

    <p>Every time I start Acrobat Reader the windows installer starts up. I have to keep cancelling the windows installer dialog box until it finally goes away before AR starts. </p>
<p>I usually click cancel on the windows installer dialog box upwards of 12 times before it goes away.</p>
<p>Any suggestions of how to fix this would be appreciated. </p>
<p>If this can't be fixed, then AR 6.01 sucks big time.</p>
