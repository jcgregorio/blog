  <p>Apple's marketing is breathtaking. They start with a perfectly good MP3 player, 
rip out the display so you have no idea which song is playing, 
lock the thing into permanent shuffle mode and call it a feature.
Actually, they go even further and make it the primary selling point, naming  
it '<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">shuffle</a>' and topping it off with the tag-line 'Enjoy uncertainty.' You just have to admire their skill.</p>
<p>Just imagine what they could do for U.S. foreign policy: 'Enjoy unilateralism.'</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Several diligent readers have pointed out that the iPod shuffle is not <em>locked</em> into shuffle mode and can play songs in the playlist order if you so desire. This is no way detracts from their marketing genius.</p>

    <p>think of the shuffle this way:</p>
<p>it's a sony walkman the size of a pack of gum with space for 150 songs. It never skips or jams. The music will play in order, or at random for 7.5 hours without a repeat.</p>
<p>Do you think there is a market for that?</p>
