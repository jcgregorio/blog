      <p>ETags, or entity-tags, are an important part of HTTP, being
        a critical part of caching, and also used in "conditional" requests.
        So what is an etag?
        </p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.3.2">Entity tag</a></dt>
<dd>The ETag response-header field value, an entity tag, provides for an "opaque" cache validator.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
        That's not very helpful, is it?
        </p>
  <p>
        The easiest way to think of an etag is as an
        MD5 or SHA1 hash of all the bytes in a representation.
        If just one byte in the representation changes, the etag will change.
        </p>
<p class="aside">
        Aside: I am only talking about strong etags here. There are such
        things as weak etags, they only indicate two representations 
        are semantically equivalent. <i>Semantically equivalent</i>? 
        From here on out when I say 'etag', I mean a strong etag.
        </p>
<p>
        ETags are returned in a response to a GET:
        </p>
<pre><code>joe@joe-laptop:~$ <b>curl --include http://bitworking.org/news/</b>
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Wed, 21 Mar 2007 15:06:15 GMT
Server: Apache
<b>etag: "078de59b16c27119c670e63fa53e5b51"</b>
Content-Length: 23081
Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="content-type" /&gt;&lt;link href="/favicon.ico" type="image/ico" rel="shortcut icon" /&gt;
...
</code></pre>
<p>On a subsequent GET request you can put the value in that  <tt>ETag:</tt> header in an
        <tt>If-None-Match:</tt> header and if there is a representation that has
        that etag, i.e. if the representation hasn't changed, then the response 
        is a 304 with no entity body returned.</p>
<p>That's a great savings in bandwidth.</p>
<p> The inclusion
        of an <tt>If-*</tt> header turns any normal request into a 
        "conditional" request, in this case our GET became a 
        "conditional" GET.
        </p>
<p>
        The etag is used as a cache-validator and can 
        be combined with other cache related headers
        to great effect. See my article on XML.com:
        <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/02/01/doing-http-caching-right-introducing-httplib2.html">Doing HTTP Caching Right: Introducing httplib2</a>.
        </p>
<p>
        In addition to being used during GETs, the etag can be used
        to do a "conditional" PUT, which can be used to avoid the 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/">Lost Update Problem</a>.
        </p>
<h3>Static files</h3>
<p>
        The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd web server</a> has built in support for generating etags 
        for statically served files.
        <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#fileetag">FileETag</a> 
        allows you to set what pieces of information are used to
        generate an etag. You can choose a combination of inode, last-modified,
        and the file size.
        </p>
<p>
        Why not turn them all on? Well, in cases where you are 
        serving the same file from several servers you
        definitely want to turn off the use of the 'inode' for generating
        the etag since the inode will vary from system to system.
        </p>
<h3>Non-static content</h3>
<p>
        If you are not serving up static content then you need to do some more
        work to enable etags. How much work you do will determine how much
        benefit you get from etags. The deeper the concept of an entity-tag
        permeates your application, the more benefit you will receive.
        </p>
<p class="aside">
        Aside: Many of the things I'm talking about with ETags and
        If-* headers can also be done with a last modified
        time served in the <tt>Last-Modified:</tt> header. In general I 
        advise against using <tt>Last-Modified:</tt> since it is limited to
        a one second granularity and you may have issues with clock skew
        among a group of servers. ETags are just conceptually 
        simpler and just as powerful. This advice is only really 
        for servers, which can decide which cache-validators to 
        support, clients have no such luck and should 
        support both. 
        </p>
<h3>Constructing ETags</h3>
<p>
        How do you generate an etag? Find all the bits of information that could impact
        your representation of a resource and use that information to build
        an 'opaque' etag. I usually do that by concatenating the values of these
        key pieces of information as strings and then calculating an MD5 or SHA1 hash of that string.
        The MD5 hashed value is certainly opaque, and the MD5 hash assures that the actual
        etag is only 32 characters long, while ensuring that
        they are highly unlikely to collide. 
        </p>
<h3>A shallow implementation</h3>
<p>
        You can get away with a very shallow implementation of etags
        and get a lot of benefits to your bandwidth.  You could implement
        a simple layer in your stack that actually built the full response and
        then calculated an MD5 hash of the bytes returned and use that
        as an etag. From that simple base you could handle "conditional"
        GETs and achieve a savings in bandwidth. This isn't to be sneezed at, as
        <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/ETags__This_stuff_matters">the savings could be substantial</a>.
        </p>
<h3>A deeper implementation</h3>
<p>
        On the other hand, if you bring the concept of etags deeper into
        you application you could get even more benfits. First, you could
        support things like "conditional" PUTs, which allows clients
        to detect lost updates. [For the terminology-oriented this is a
        form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurreny</a>.]
        </p>
<p>
         Secondly, the data query
        and templating needed to create a representation may be
        the time-consuming part of the response and the bandwidth 
        savings may be negligable in comparison. In this case
        it's beneficial to bury etag support deep in your application
        and use it to shortcut the querying and templating steps.
        </p>
<p class="tip">REST Tip: Deep etags give you more benefits.</p>
<p>
        For this to work you need to pick out key values or characteristics
        of your data the will determine if a representation will
        change, and then build an etag from that. For example, in 
        the case of files, Apache httpd uses a combination of 
        inode, last-modified time, and the file size. For your
        application you may already store a timestamp of when
        each resource is modified, which is perfect information 
        to fold into an etag.
        </p>
<p>In the case of data stored in a database, if a resource is tied
        to a single row in a table then a simple timestamp or revision number 
        on the row is a good source of information for generating an etag.
        But that is just one source. If you then process that through a 
        template then the 'version' of the template also needs to used in
        calculating your etag. A change to the template would alter the
        representation even though the revision number for a row in the database
        didn't change, so both need to be used together when calculating 
        the etag.
        </p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of deep etags that 
           avoid a lot of computation.</p>
<p>Here is the bit of code in the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparklines</a> 
        web service that checks for matching etags:
        </p>
<pre><code>if_none_match = os.environ.get('<span class="Constant">HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH</span>', '')
<span class="Statement">if</span> if_none_match <span class="Statement">and</span> str(hash(os.environ.get('<span class="Constant">QUERY_STRING</span>', '') + __version__)) == if_none_match:
    not_modified()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/spark.py">The whole source file is available</a>. 
        In this case the etag is driven off the query parameters passed into the service and
           the version of the file <code>spark.cgi</code> itself. 
           </p>
<p>I took a slightly different approach in the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/critters/">Critter Generator</a>
              and instead of using the file version I used the last-modified timestamp 
              of the program.
              </p>
<pre><code><span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">etag</span>(critterid):
    file_version = os.stat(sys.argv[0]).st_mtime
    etag = sha.sha(critterid)
    etag.update(str(file_version))
    <span class="Statement">return</span> '<span class="Constant">"%s"</span>' % etag.hexdigest()
</code></pre>
<p>In both of these services the etag check is done very early and 
              avoids all of the calculations required for a non-matching response.
              </p>
<h3>But I use a database...</h3>
<p>
              You have a good knowledge of your domain and can come up with
              a method of determining an etag from your data. Maybe the
              data is never updated, or you keep track of updates already, or
              your database keeps fine grained timestamps on rows
              that you can use for etag generation.
              </p>
<p>
              You should use those.
              </p>
<p>
              What I'm going to show you is a sledge hammer approach
              that doesn't rely on specialized knowledge of your problem domain.
              Like all sledgehammers, it's a heavy tool that should be applied 
              with care.
              </p>
<p>
              If your resource maps one to one with a row in a table, and you keep a revision number
              for each row then you can use that as a value to build an etag.
              </p>
<p>
              This technique doens't require adding any code to 
              update the revision number on the rows, that can be done
              by using a trigger. Here is an example from SQLite:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE notes (
     id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
     note      TEXT,
     rev       INTEGER DEFAULT 0);
CREATE TRIGGER insert_notes_revision AFTER UPDATE ON notes
        BEGIN
          UPDATE notes SET 
                rev = rev+1 
            WHERE id = new.id; 
        END;
</code></pre>
<p>Let's look at some Python code that handles this, <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/etag-sqlite/main.cgi/note/">a trivial Python application
           for editing 'notes'</a>. Just editing. You can't even add or delete
       notes, just edit them. 
       <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/etag-sqlite/">All of the code for this sample is available here</a>. 
       This service is built on my throw away Python framework <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/robaccia/">Robaccia</a>.
       Here are the modifications
       to <code>robaccia.py</code>. Note that <code>render()</code> depends upon the caller passing in
       some information, <code>raw_etag</code>, to be used as a basis for an etag. It then adds in a dependency on the last-modified timestamp of 
       the template file. It returns a 304 if appropriate, otherwise
       it includes the calculated entity tag in the <tt>ETag:</tt> header.
    </p>
<pre><code><span class="Statement">def</span> <span class="Identifier">render</span>(environ, start_response, template_file, vars, headers={}, status="<span class="Constant">200 Ok</span>", raw_etag=None):
    <b>

    <span class="Statement">if</span> raw_etag:
        last_modified = str(os.stat(file).st_mtime)
        hash = md5.new(raw_etag)
        hash.update(last_modified)
        etag = '<span class="Constant">"%s"</span>' % hash.hexdigest()
        headers['<span class="Constant">etag</span>'] = etag
        <span class="Statement">if</span> etag == environ.get('<span class="Constant">HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH</span>', ''):

            <span class="Statement">return</span> []
    </b>
    (contenttype, serialization) = ('<span class="Constant">text/html; charset=utf-8</span>', '<span class="Constant">html</span>')
    ext = template_file.rsplit("<span class="Constant">.</span>")
    <span class="Statement">if</span> len(ext) &gt; 1 <span class="Statement">and</span> (ext[1] <span class="Statement">in</span> extensions):
        (contenttype, serialization) = extensions[ext[1]]
    <span class="Comment"># Only serve XHTML to those clients that can understand it.</span>
<span class="Statement">if</span> serialization <span class="Statement">in</span> matching:
        best = mimeparse.best_match(matching.keys(), environ.get('<span class="Constant">HTTP_ACCEPT</span>', '<span class="Constant">application/xhtml+xml</span>'))
        (contenttype, serialization) = (best, match[best])
    <span class="Statement">if</span> serialization == '<span class="Constant">xhtml</span>' <span class="Statement">and</span> environ.get('<span class="Constant">HTTP_USER_AGENT</span>', '').find("<span class="Constant">MSIE</span>") &gt;= 0:

    template = kid.Template(file, **vars)
    body = template.serialize(output=serialization, encoding='<span class="Constant">utf-8</span>')
    headers['<span class="Constant">Content-Type</span>'] = contenttype
    start_response(status, list(headers.iteritems()))
    <span class="Statement">return</span> [body]</code></pre>
<p>And here is the view implementation, based on <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/wsgicollection/">wsgicollection</a>.
    The <code>_raw_etag()</code> method is what builds up the raw information to be used
    in the calculation of the etag. In this case it is just a concatenation
    of all the 'rev' columns in the rows used to generate the response.

        id = environ['<span class="Constant">wsgiorg.routing_args</span>'][1]['<span class="Constant">id</span>']
        f = environ['<span class="Constant">formpostdata</span>']
        note = f.get('<span class="Constant">note</span>', ['<span class="Constant">no note found</span>'])[0]
        rev = f.get('<span class="Constant">rev</span>', ['<span class="Constant">no rev found</span>'])[0]
        c.execute('<span class="Constant">update notes set note=:note where id=:id;</span>', locals())
        dbconfig.connection.commit()

        <span class="Statement">return</span> []</code></pre>
<p>You'll note that this implementation requires looking at all the 
    rows that will be used to generate the response, so this technique
    isn't going to save you any computation time; it will only save bandwidth, and
    the processing time for the templates.</p>
<p> I told you it was a sledgehammer. </p>
<p>One more thing to note, look at the implementation of <code>_raw_etag()</code>, it concatenates the 'id' and 'rev'
    for each row used to build the representation. If this list ran to hundreds of items and
    we didn't form the etag from an MD5 hash of <code>raw_etag</code>, then we'd end up 
    schlepping around an etag hundreds of bytes long, which is no way to save bandwidth.
    </p>
<p>Again, the point isn't to show you exactly how you should be
    implementing etags, but to give you some ideas
  on how to start, and how 
    you can use them to speed up your application. The deeper you build 
    etags into your application, and the earlier to start thinking about
    them, the better off you'll be.

    <p>Very good post (as always)!
</p><p>
Another possibility for etag generation is not to do it yourself but let the httpd do it by creating static content. If you create static files of your database content then Apache could serve them with etags, last modified, etc. in the most efficient way. This of course is not feasible in all cases. A usual use case to do such a thing is for serving RSS/Atom feeds where the static files can be generated (or can be checked if they need to be generated), let's say, every 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
If someone is worried about serving stale information by following this periodic generation of static files there are ways to avoid the staleness. As an extreme example, in the past I have  implemented the following: I created a database trigger that deletes (!) the static file when the database is updated and I configured Apache (with mod_rewrite) so that when the static file is referenced but does not exist a cgi should run that, based on the database content, recreates the static file. That way I had always fresh content delivered through the static files and these files are created in a lazy, on demand manner.

    Good stuff, Joe.  Thanks.  One minor nit: The trigger you show might be better named "insert_notes_revision" rather than "insert_notes_timeStamp."

    Regarding the Last-Modified header advice, if that data is considered useful by the server-developer one can always send that data <em>as</em> the etag.  I can't imagine too many interests in doing things this way, but it testifies to the flexibility of etags.

    In PHP I make a lot of use of PEAR::Cache.  Depending on the program (of course) the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Cache/docs/latest/Cache/Cache.html#methodgenerateID">PEAR::Cache-&gt;generateID()</a> makes for a great base for an etag generator.

    Great article; thanks, Joe.

One thing I'd like to add for anyone who chances upon this is that if you're using Apache + Server Side Includes, Etags are silently and automatically disabled.  I have even tried to set an Etag header within an SSI document (hey, who knows, right?) and discovered that it doesn't work either.  It sucks that I can't use Etags w/ SSI, especially when 90% of the hits could legitimately use an Etag, but I guess I can't always have cake and eat it too.

    Very nice walk-through, Joe. But shouldn't the header name be "ETag" rather than "etag"?
