      <p>
When putting together a table to describe your REST service, and believe
me, I've been seeing <b>a lot</b> of these tables recently, there needs to be a 
distinction between the server view and the client view.
</p>
<p>
For example, here is our table for the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/125/REST-and-WS#rest-recipe">employee service
    from my worked example of how to create a RESTful protocol</a>:
</p>
  <table>
<caption>Table 1: Employee Web Service</caption>
<tr> <th>Resource</th> <th>URI</th> <th>Method</th> <th>Representation</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <td rowspan="2">Employee List</td> <td rowspan="2">/employees/</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON (emp list)</td> <td>Retrieve the list of employees</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>POST</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Create a new employee</td> </tr>
<tr> <td rowspan="3">Employee</td> <td rowspan="3">/employees/{employee-id}</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Retrieve an employee</td></tr>
<tr> <td>PUT</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Update an employee</td></tr>
<tr> <td>DELETE</td> <td>-</td> <td>Remove an employee</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The important point is that this is the server's view
of the service, the table is a guide to the implementor
of the service on how to structure the URIs. The view
that actually gets documented and presented to the client
needs to be slightly different, the most important 
part being the replacement of URI construction with links.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, here is an example of the employee list, which contains
the URIs of the employee resources.
    </p>
<pre><code>
  [
    {
      "name": "Joe Gregorio",
      "href": "jcg111002222"
    },
    {
      "name": "John Q. Public",
      "href": "jqp333445555"
    },
    ...
  ]
</code></pre>
<p class="caption">
<b>Figure 1</b><br />
    Employee List JSON Representation
    </p>
<p>
Here is our table as it should be presented to client implementors:
</p>
<table>
<caption>Table 2: Employee Web Service</caption>
<tr> <th>Resource</th> <th>URI</th> <th>Method</th> <th>Representation</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <td rowspan="2">Employee List</td> <td rowspan="2">/employees/</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON (emp list)</td> <td>Retrieve the list of employees</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>POST</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Create a new employee</td> </tr>
<tr> <td rowspan="3">Employee</td> <td rowspan="3">Found in the 'href' of each object in Employee List.</td> <td>GET</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Retrieve an employee</td></tr>
<tr> <td>PUT</td> <td>JSON (employee)</td> <td>Update an employee</td></tr>
<tr> <td>DELETE</td> <td>-</td> <td>Remove an employee</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that the client doesn't get to 'know' how to
construct employee URIs from <code>employee-ids</code>, instead it just follows links
from the employee list to each employee resource.
</p>
<p class="tip">Tip: Prefer following links over URI construction.</p>
<p>
There are still cases for URI construction, where the
representation given is really a recipe for how to
construct a URI, such as an HTML form, or an 
<a href="http://opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a> document. Even in these cases, the client doesn't have
hard-coded knowledge on how to construct a 
URI, it is only following the recipe in the HTML form, or 
OpenSearch document. If the recipe gets updated
the client will follow the new recipe without needing to
be modified.
</p>
<p>There are several advantages to keeping 
  URI construction out of view of the client:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Simpler Client Code</dt>
<dd>The client code is simpler, dereferencing a (possibly relative) URI
    is simpler than constructing a URI and <i>then</i> dereferencing it.
    </dd>
<dt>Server flexibility</dt>
<dd>
    The URIs on the server side can be changed
    as needed without having to update
    all the clients. Yes, you should strive for 
    unchanging <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs</a>, but 
    mistakes happen and this lets you fix those mistakes without
    updating the clients.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>This isn't just idle theory, at one point in the 
   development of the Atom Publishing Protocol there
   was a push for a form of URI construction, a WebDAV like use of the URI path
   for creating and manipulating resources.
   Luckily that never made it into the specification, because now I can 
   create a service document for a group of APP collections that currently 
   don't have service documents:
</p>
<p>The resource at <code><a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/gdata/gdata-service.atomserv">http://bitworking.org/projects/gdata/gdata-service.atomserv</a></code>
is a service document for all my <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html">APP collections on Google</a>, and it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
&lt;service xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/app#"  xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
  &lt;workspace&gt; 
    &lt;atom:title&gt;Google&lt;/atom:title&gt;
    &lt;collection href="http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/default/private/full"&gt;
        &lt;atom:title&gt;Calendar&lt;/atom:title&gt;
    &lt;/collection&gt;
    &lt;collection href="http://base.google.com/base/feeds/items" &gt;
        &lt;atom:title&gt;Base&lt;/atom:title&gt;
    &lt;/collection&gt;
    &lt;collection href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6464869902972579239/posts/default" &gt;
        &lt;atom:title&gt;Blogger (jcgregorio)&lt;/atom:title&gt;
    &lt;/collection&gt;
    &lt;collection href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/spreadsheets/private/full" &gt;
        &lt;atom:title&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/atom:title&gt;
    &lt;/collection&gt;
  &lt;/workspace&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>I'm sure this is a small error, but your server table shows a URI /employees/{employee-id} and your client table instructs them to follow what would only be /{employee-id}</p>
<p>I considered making a joke about using XSLT to generate your client table from your server table, but given the nature of the 'net I'm afraid I'd be taken seriously :)</p>

    Josh,<br />
<p>The links in the Employee List are relative URIs. They are relative to the URI from which the Employee List was retrieved. 
So if our service was located at <code>http://example.com/employees/</code>, then  one employee list URI would be:
</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/employees/jcg111002222</code></pre>
<p>A good URI parsing library makes this easy:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urlparse
&gt;&gt;&gt; urlparse.urljoin("http://example.com/employees/", "jcg11102222")
'http://example.com/employees/jcg11102222'
&gt;&gt;&gt;

    Thanks for pointing that out Joe.  That makes a good deal of sense, but I think I would have implemented it incorrectly if I had to make an implementation.

    I contrasted/compared this approach a while back in an entry called <a href="http://netzooid.com/blog/2006/12/07/resource-vs-service-oriented-data-design/">Resource vs. Service Oriented Data Design</a>. They're two very different approaches. I tend to like the linkable approach you're advocating a lot better.

    Relative links seem difficult -- moving the resources around requires understanding where the links are, and there's no standard or even convention in JSON as to where the links are located.  xml:base offers a solution to this, or if you are using HTML the &lt;base&gt; tag, or with HTML you can more-or-less know what attributes need to be changed.  But with JSON it's more difficult, and so the document isn't really self-describing -- it only is meaningful in the context of the location of the container, and you'll have to drag both around.  But anyway, that's a minor detail.<br /><br />

What this doesn't seem to address is random access.  Getting a complete employee list is difficult.  You could do a query, like /employees/?id=jcg111002222, giving back the same JSON document but with only that one entry.  But that's just /employees/?id={employee-id} -- how is that any more abstract than /employees/{employee-id} ?  For indirection you can use redirects.  This is not without its problems, but the problems don't seem any worse than the alternative.

<p>Links are links, those links in the employee could be relative or absolute, and the code I supplied would work the same. True, there are no conventions in JSON, the story for XML is good, and the story for HTML is even better being <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html">over 10 years old</a>.
</p>
<p>A query that only allowed searches by id seems rather useless. That's like
 Google only allowing searches where you put in the URI
  of the thing you're looking for. A more useful
search would be:</p>
<pre><code>/employees/?name=Joe</code></pre>
<blockquote><p>This is not without its problems, but the problems don't seem any worse than the alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is true, but only for small values of 'Google'.</p>

    Joe,

On a freshly initialized system, with no employees yet in the database, would an initial request of PUT /employees/mdubinko create a new record or return a 404?

Or is it up to the server to decide whether or not it wants to allow clients to control URLspace mapping? -m

    Micah,<br />
<p>It's up to the server to decide whether it wants to allow creation via PUT or via POST to <code>/employees/</code>. In this particular worked example, POST is used for creation.
</p>
<p>In general I prefer creation via POST as it leaves control of the URI space in the hands of the server, and it avoids potential race conditions.

    <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>Is there a best practice (yet) when you want to have part of your resources publicly accessible and part of it restricted to some users?</p>
<p>Is it better to use different <em>bases</em> in that case (e.g. /employees vs /private/employees)? I feel that using only /employees would be confusing as some GETs will work and some no (if you have not been authenticated of course)</p>
<p>And speaking of authentication, is there a best practice (yet)? I've been reading a lot lately and there seems to be no consensus on that matter.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
