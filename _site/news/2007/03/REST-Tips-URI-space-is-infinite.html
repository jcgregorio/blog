  <meta name="twitter:description" content="  One of the questions that has arisen several times recently is 
validation using REST. 


The scenario is that a client, a web page or some other
agent, needs to do some quick validation for feedback to 
the user. For example, when entering a zipcode into 
a form we'd like to check that zipcode as it's
entered and display some visual feedback when it's valid. 


Let's follow our REST recipe and see what we end up with:

  
Find the nouns (resources).
    Determine the representations.
    Pick the methods.
    Highlight specific status codes.


The noun in this case is a zipcode.

zipcode/{zipcode}

The representation will be a PNG file of a happy
green checkmark.


The method will obviously be GET.


For status codes, if the given zipcode is not a valid
one then we will return a 404 Not Found, and a PNG of a
red X, otherwise we return a 200 Ok for the happy green
checkmark.


Note that we are returing small PNGs to make the 
web page easy to construct, and we are also 
sending back a 200 only on a good 
zipcode, which means that a client can 
programatically use this service by 
just checking the status code returned, ignoring
the PNG.


The trick here is not caring about the size of the URI
space we are creating. The number of potential
URIs in /zipcode/{zipcode}
is huge if we include all the 404's in there.
That is, the valid URIs in /zipcode/{zipcode}
are sparse. But since we are only keeping a list of
valid zipcodes we don't have to keep track
of the 404 space, only its complement.
That is, I know /zipcode/foo isn't a valid
zipcode, but I don't have 'foo' in a file somewhere.
This is one example of a more general principal:


Tip: It's useful to think of URI space as infinite.


As specified in RFC 3986, URIs are not limited in length.
In reality servers, browsers, and proxies have various limits
that in practice bring the number down to 4096 characters. 
Let's do a quick back of the envelope calculation: if you 
just consider [a-zA-Z0-9] as a really stripped down set of 
characters allowed in a URI and then look at the 
longest practical URI, you are looking at roughly 62^4000 addressable resources. Just to put that in perspective
a rough estimate for the number of atoms in the
    observable universe  is 10^81.


URI space is infinite.


Here is the code for the lookup service. It presumes
the existence of a file that contains all the valid 
zipcodes, sorted, with one per line. The file I used
is very old and comes from the census bureau, so
please don't use this service for anything 
legitimate; it's only presented for demonstration.

from mmap import mmap
import os
from bisect import bisect_left
import sys
class Zipcodes(object):
    """Use mmap to treat the sorted file of zipcodes
    as an array"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.f = open("sortzips.txt", "r+")
        self.size = os.path.getsize("sortzips.txt")
        self.m = mmap(self.f.fileno(), self.size)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        self.m.seek(6*i)
        return self.m.read(5)
    def __del__(self):
        self.m.close()
        self.f.close()
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size / 6
zipcodes = Zipcodes()
target = os.environ.get('PATH_INFO', '/')[1:]
found = ( zipcodes[bisect_left(zipcodes, target)] == target )
print "Status: " + ( found and "200 Ok" or "404 Not Found" )
print "Cache-control: max-age=172800"
print "Content-type: image/png"
print ""
f = open(found and "good.png" or "bad.png", "r")
png = f.read()
f.close()
sys.stdout.write(png)


Here is a simple web page that uses the service. You
can view source on that page to see the tiny amount of JavaScript needed.

  
    I couldn't agree more.
OTOH, do you find people thinking that the URI space should be smaller and more finite? It hadn't occurred to me anyone would think that way until someone I work with made a point that a certain technique I was advocating resulted in more URIs than his preferred method and as such he felt my preferred method was less desirable for that (as well as other) reason(s). I'd explain what we were debating, but it's a long story planned for a long blog post one day (not our debate, but the technique I was advocating.)
Anyway, it reminds me of this time when this other guy I used to work with who had a really geeky sense of humor wrote a web page with a GUID generator (this was way back when GUIDs were actually a relatively new programming solution.) So I started refreshing the page watching the GUID change which caused him to yell at me (in a purposefully nasally voice): "Stop it....You're gonna use them all up!" ;-)

    "OTOH, do you find people thinking that the URI space should be smaller and more finite?"
Definitely. I don't mind using uids and md5 hashes for certain apps handling machine generated masses of content, but I think people like "socialable urls" which reduces the number to countably infinite at best, and more likely to be "lots" in practice. They don't need infinite URLs, they need nice ones (it's exactly the same for domain names)
For example, I know people can't stand Vignette URLs (the numerical ones with commas). For another example, lastfm's and wikipedia's URL spaces are highly elegant; I suspect it's one of the reason's wikipdedia is successful. Yet flickr is doing fine with hashes.
"Let's do a quick back of the envelope calculation"
Domain names will bring the calculated order down; maybe to the number of stars in the universe or something sufficient.

    Bill,
"Domain names will bring the calculated order down; maybe to the number of stars in the universe or something sufficient."
I was actually expecting that complaint, which is why I used 4000 instead of 4096, to leave room for domain name.

    I seem to remember that when we were working on Webarch in the TAG, we were told that the 4096-byte limit on URIs was, practically speaking, distant history.

    Queries that return images like this are bad for accessibility: How do you present alternate text for disabled users (or for any sort of automated post-processing)?

As an example it's cute, but in practice I would only return a boolean value, and leave the display to my presentation layer.

    HEAD would suffice for the existence check and content negotiation would allow for different representations. 

The choice of <b>lookup</b> is surprising. It makes this look like a RPC, which might have been the goal. I would have expected the URI to have an all noun form, seeing it identifies a resource.

This is obviously US centric so a URI of the form postalcode/us/90250 would be more general. Of course, that could be an alias for zipcode/90250.

    Thought provoking post. I think you miss a trick by not expanding more on the reuse benefits of this approach. For example, by creating a global set of resources with a uniform interface you could validate either at client-side or server-side, with any chosen programming language, in batch or singly. Plus, this validation capability is accessible to everyone all at once without needing to negotiate database formats or access methods with you.

    Great stuff. One thing that you might stress (you do in the code, but not so much in the text) is that caching buys you a lot in this scenario. The performance of such a system would be excellent compared to a SOAP service because clients would eventually cache the most commonly used zipcodes forever. Also like Matt said, the service might be a bit more realistic if it returned something meaningful like a document containing city/state of the like. This would show that REST really is superior for these sorts of lookup (stock quotes, address query, price checks, existence checks) services that so many companies use SOAP for internally.

</p><p>Not sure if you've seen my blog or paid much attention to my rants on rest-discuss but if so you know what an advocate I am for "socialable urls" (your term, but I like it.) However, I wonder if it isn't the number of URLs so much as the organization and discoverability of those URLs?  In other words, if there are patterns that people can understand, a large number isn't a problem. Joe's zipcode URLs are a perfect example; why does it matter if there are tens of thousands if I know that mine is just this: "/zipcode/30308"
</p><p>&gt;&gt; For example, I know people can't stand Vignette URLs (the numerical ones with commas). 
</p><p>Ohhh, I despise Vignette's URLs!
</p><p>&gt;&gt; For another example, lastfm's and wikipedia's URL spaces are highly elegant; I suspect it's one of the reason's wikipdedia is successful. 
</p><p>I so agree with that!
</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yet flickr is doing fine with hashes.
</p><p>Question is: Could Flickr be doing better with better URLs?</p>

    While the code you posted is (obviously) legal code, it's a bit confusing that you named a variable "zip".  I kept staring at it, trying to figure out what n iterables you were combining.  Maybe you could change the name of the variable to "zipcodes"?

<p>Good point, I've updated to the code to use <code>zipcodes</code> instead of <code>zip</code>.
