      <p>Several months ago I was starting to get
fairly frustrated with myself - I wasn't able to 
work in long shifts and didn't seem to be able to 
concentrate as well I used to. I tried various
things such as altering my diet, my exercise routine, any my
sleeping, but nothing seemed to help. On top of it all
I had inexplicably cut down on my book reading. It was
starting to really grate on me until
a few weeks ago when I was reading a book and one of kids 
interrupted me - I looked up,
answered their question, and turned back to 
find the page was a blurry mess.
</p>
<p>
Hey, maybe I need glasses?
</p><p>
Now I've had 20/20 vision all my life so needing glasses
had never crossed my mind, but at my appointment
later that week the optometrist assured
me that this was completely normal, "at my age".
</p><p>
Ouch.
</p><p>
Anyway, I now have reading glasses. 
I've had them for a week and half and not only 
can I work longer stretches but now I'm
back to reading books, and tearing through them at
a brisk pace. In the past
week and a half I've finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=discworld">two Discworld novels</a>
 (Very funny, lots more books in the series, looking forward
to reading them all.), 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0743296281/">Lies My Teacher Told Me</a> (History should have been this good while I was in school.), 
and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Candesce-Book-Two-Virga/dp/0765315440/">Queen of Candesce</a> (Not as good as Sun of Suns, but still
an enjoyable romp through an interesting world.).
</p><p>
The other benefit, above and beyond the whole being-able-to-see thing, is 
that I've discovered that letting the glasses slide down
my nose and looking over the top of them at her drives Lynne up the wall.

    If you enjoyed both Pratchett and Schroeder, you should check out "The Lies of Locke Lamora" by Scott Lynch.

    So you've discovered Discworld. Out of the countless (maybe 15 or so) books I've read I think there's only one that I've failed to find it a delight to read, and that one wasn't that bad. He seems to have boundless creativity.

    Ahh,  can't read the extremely small font on restaurant menus, the first sign of old man's disease.  Next you'll be asking the waitress to turn down the music.
<p>
You're doing better than me... I lived in denial for at least a year before I broke down and bought reading glasses.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah...

    Joe, FWIW including cod liver oil tablets in my diet has improved my eye-sight and concentration levels.

ps. Instead of a red; "Your comment has been accepted..." message can you make it green or something? Gave me a; did that fail... shock before I read what it said. :)
