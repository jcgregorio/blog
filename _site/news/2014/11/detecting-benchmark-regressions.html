  <meta name="twitter:description" content="  Subtitle if this were an academic paper, which
    it’s not: A k-means clustering derived point statistic highly
    correlated with regressions in commit-series data with applications
    to automatic anomaly detection in large sets of benchmark
    results.
  TL;DR: To detect
    regressions in benchmark data over a series of commits use k-means
    clustering on mean and variance normed commit-series. For each of the
    clusters find the best fitting step function to each cluster’s centroid. The
    metric |step/fit| is highly correlated with regressions, where step is the
    height of the step function, and fit is the mean square error of the fit of
    the step function to the centroid.
  
  
    Below is the description of how we detect performance regression for the Skia graphics library. I’m
    writing this up because after much searching I haven’t found anyone describe
    the method we came up with for detecting performance regressions and maybe
    this writeup will be useful to other people.
  
  Problem Statement
  Skia is an open source cross platform 2D
    graphics library. In Skia, like many other software projects, we
    have large number of performance tests, aka benchmarks, and we run
    those benchmarks every time we change the code. Just having a large
    number of benchmarks isn’t a problem, but being cross
    platform means running those tests across many different platforms;
    Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, ChromeOS, on different GPUs, etc.
    which leads to a combinatorial explosion in benchmark results. For
    every commit to Skia today the testing infrastructure generates
    approximately 40,000 benchmark measurements. That number of results
    tends to change frequently as tests, platforms, and configurations
    are added and removed regularly. The number of results has been
    over 70,000 per commit in the past several months.
  Definitions
  To make the following discussion easier
    let’s define some terms.
  
    Trace
    
    A Trace is single benchmark and configuration
    tracked over a series of commits. Note that this isn’t
    exactly a time series since the measurements aren’t taken at
    equidistant times, but are spaced by commits to the codebase. Also
    note that for each benchmark there may be multiple traces, for
    example, one for Windows 8, one for Linux, and one for
    Android.
    
  
  
    
  Fig 1 - Trace
  
    Regression
    
    A “performance regression” is a significant change in either
    direction of a metric. Now a metric that drops may actually be a good
    performance increase, but could also be an indication of a test that is
    broken, or has stopped working entirely. So regardless of the benchmark,
    we are looking for step-like changes in either direction.

    <dd>
    A “performance regression” is a significant change in either
    direction of a metric. Now a metric that drops may actually be a good
    performance increase, but could also be an indication of a test that is
    broken, or has stopped working entirely. So regardless of the benchmark,
    we are looking for step-like changes in either direction.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    The issue with tens of thousands of traces is
    that you just can’t look at the raw numbers, or even plot all
    the data, and figure out when you’ve had a regression. At
    first we tried setting performance ranges for each trace, i.e. an
    upper and lower bound for each trace. If a later commit caused the
    benchmark results to move outside those bounds then that would
    trigger an error. There are many
    drawbacks to monitoring benchmarks by manually placing bounds
    on each trace:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The most important drawback is that in such
        a system a single test result can trigger an alert. You know old
        phrase, “the plural of anecdote isn&#39;t data”, a single
        benchmark measurement is virtually meaningless as any number of
        anomalies could actually be responsible for that benchmark result
        changing. For example, a machine could overheat forcing a move to
        frequency scaling, or other processes on the machine may starve the
        test of CPU cycles. You can work to mitigate these eventualities,
        but they never completely go away. SPC systems such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric_rules">Western Electric rules</a>
        might be applicable in this case, but we’ve never tested them.</li>
    <li>Constant manual editing of trace bounds is
        time consuming and error prone.</li>
    <li>Constantly adding manual trace bounds for
        new benchmarks is time consuming. Add one test and you may have to
        add many trace bounds, one for each member of that combinatorial
        explosion.</li>
    <li>Forgetting to add new ranges for new
        benchmarks another source of error.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Even if you automate the placing of trace
    bounds, you still have the issue of transient behavior that looks
    like a regression, and you also have to take pains that the
    automatic calculation of trace bounds doesn’t mask a true
    regression.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; width: 460.50px; height: 223.10px;">
    <img alt="" src="/images/detect/image00.png" style="width: 460.50px; height: 223.10px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px;" title="A trace with a possible regression."/></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Fig 2- Is this a regression or an anomaly?</p>
  <p>So we needed a better system than setting trace
    bounds. The next section explains the system we implemented and
    have successfully run for several months now.</p>
  <p>Before we go further let’s define a few more terms.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Normalized Traces</dt>
    <dd>
      Normalization is the process of modifying each Trace so that it has a mean
      of zero and a standard deviation of 1.0. Note that if the standard deviation
      of a trace is too small, then blowing that up to a standard deviation of 1.0
      would introduce nothing but noise, so there’s a lower limit for the
      standard deviation of a trace, and below that we don’t normalize the
      standard deviation of the trace. The idea is to extract just the shape of
      the trace, so that all the normalized traces are comparable using a sum of
      squares distance metric. The smaller the sum of squares error is between two
      normalized trace, the more similar their shapes.
    </dd>
    <dt>k-means clustering</dt>
    <dd>
    I’m not going to explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a> in one paragraph, you
      should go look it up on Wikipedia or any of the fine explanations
      available on the web. The important point is that we are using k-means
      clustering to group normalized traces together based on their shape. The
      idea is that many traces will move together in the same direction from
      commit to commit. For example, if I speed up rectangle drawing then all
      tests that use rectangles should get faster, if not in the same
      proportion.
    </dd>
    <dt>Centroid</dt>
    <dd>
      The centroid is the center point at the center of a cluster. In this case
      the mean of the normalized traces in a cluster, which acts as a prototype
      shape for the members of the cluster.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>Regression Factor</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        For each cluster of normalized traces we find
        the best fitting step function to the centroid. From that best
        fitting step function we calculate Fit and Step, where Fit is the
        sum of squares error between the step function and the centroid,
        and Step is the height of the step function.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; width: 333.00px; height: 107.29px;">
        <img alt="" src="/images/detect/image03.png" style="width: 333.00px; height: 107.29px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px;" title="Step function"/></span></p>
      <p>From there we calculate the Regression Factor:</p>
      <code>R = Step / Fit</code>
      <p>
        A smaller Fit values gives you a larger R,
        which means that the more a centroid looks like step function the
        larger R gets. Similarly the larger Step gets the larger R gets,
        which is a measure of how big of a change the centroid
        represents.
      </p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2 id="h.xfpchl4nta06">Putting it all together.</h2>
  <p>
    So finally, with all the preliminaries set up,
    we can get to the core of the system.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect all Traces over a specific range of
        commits. We usually use around the last 100-250 commits worth of
        data.</li>
    <li>Normalize all the Traces.</li>
    <li>Perform k-means clustering on all the
        Normalized Traces.</li>
    <li>For each cluster calculate the Regression
        Factor of the centroid.</li>
    <li>Any cluster with a Regression Factor whose
        absolute value is over 150 is considered interesting enough to need
        triaging. Note that 150 was chosen after observing the system in
        action for a while, the cutoff may be different for your
        data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here’s a view of the system at work,
    finding regressions in performance. Note that out of 40,000
    benchmarks the first cluster contains 1336 traces and has a
    Regression Factor of -4.08e+3.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; width: 624.00px; height: 694.67px;">
    <img alt="Screenshot 2014-11-23 at 1.14.19 PM.png" src="/images/detect/image02.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 694.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px;" title="A series of clusters with detected regressions."/></span></p>
  <h2 id="h.r0obfl8u43xq">Continuous Analysis</h2>
  <p>The above system works for finding regressions
    once. But what happens if you want to check for regressions
    continuously as new commits land and new benchmark results arrive?
    One last definition:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Interesting</dt>
    <dd>A cluster is considered interesting if
    it’s Regression Factor is over 150. This is only a rule of
    thumb based on observing the system and may be relevant only to the
    Skia benchmarks, while a different cutoff may be appropriate for
    other datasets. The important point in that as |R| grows so does
    the likelihood of that cluster being a regression.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>To continuously monitor for Interesting
    clusters, start by running the above analysis once and find
    interesting clusters. If there are any then triage them as either
    really needing attention, such as a CL needs to be rolled back, or
    ignorable, say in the case where a true performance increase was
    seen.  Then on a periodic basis run the analysis again when
    new data arrives. What should be done with the new set of
    interesting clusters produced from the analysis? The existing
    interesting clusters have already been triaged, and those same
    clusters may appear in the output of the analysis, and new
    interesting clusters may appear. The process of only raising up new
    interesting clusters for triaging while folding existing clusters
    with similar clusters that appear in the analysis results is called
    cluster coalescing.</p>
  <p>Cluster coalescing currently works by looking
    at all the new interesting clusters and if they have the same
    traces as the 20 best traces in an existing cluster then they are
    considered the same cluster. Note that ‘best’ means the
    20 traces that are closest to the centroid of a cluster. Note that
    this is an area of active work and we are still experimenting
    regularly with new cluster coalescing schemes.</p>
