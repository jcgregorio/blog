<p>
JavaScript frameworks seem like death and taxes; inevitable and unavoidable.
I&#39;m sure that if I could be a fly on that wall every time someone started a
new web project, the very first question they&#39;d ask is, which JS framework are
we using? That&#39;s how ingrained the role of JS frameworks are in the industry
today. But that&#39;s not the way it needs to be, and actually, it needs to stop.
</p>

<p>
Let&#39;s back up and see how we got here.
</p>

<blockquote><p>Angular and Backbone and Ember, oh my.</p></blockquote>

<p>
For a long time the <a href="http://platform.html5.org/">web platform</a>, the technology
stack most succinctly described as HTML+CSS+JS, was, for lack of a better
term, a disaster. Who can forget the IE box model, or the layer tag? I&#39;m sure
I just started several of you twitching with flashbacks to the bad old days of
web development with just those words.
</p>

<p>
For a long time there was a whole lot of inconsistency between browsers and
we, as an industry, had to write frameworks to paper over them. The problem is
that there was disagreement even on the fundamental issues among browsers, like
how events propagate, or what tags to support, so every framework not only
papered over the holes, but designed their own model of how the browser should
work. Actually their own model<em>s</em>, plural, because you got to invent a model for
how events propagate, a model for how to interact with the DOM, etc.
A lot of inventing went on. So frameworks were written, each one a
snowflake, a thousand flowers bloomed and gave us the likes of jQuery and Dojo
and MochiKit and Ext JS and AngularJS and Backbone and Ember and React. For
the past <em>ten</em> years we’ve been churning out a steady parade of JS frameworks.
</p>

<p>
But something else has happened over the past ten years; browsers got better.
Their support for standards improved, and now there are evergreen browsers:
automatically updating browsers, each version more capable and standards
compliant than the last. With newer standards like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/">HTML Imports</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe">Object.observe</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/">Promises</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-template-element">HTML Templates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
I think it&#39;s time to rethink the
model of JS frameworks. There&#39;s no need to invent yet another way to do
something, just use HTML+CSS+JS.
</p>

<p>
So why are we still writing JS frameworks? I think a large part of it is
inertia, it&#39;s habit. But is that so bad, it&#39;s not like frameworks are actively
harmful, right? Well, let&#39;s first start off by defining what I mean by web
framework. There&#39;s actually a gradient of code that starts with a simple
snippet of code, such as a Gist, and that moves to larger and larger
collections of code, moving up to libraries, and finally frameworks:
</p>

<blockquote><p>gist -&gt; library -&gt; framework </p></blockquote>

<p>
Frameworks aren&#39;t just big libraries, they have their own models for how to
interact with events, with the DOM, etc. So why avoid frameworks?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Abstractions</strong> Well, one of the problems of frameworks is usually one of their
selling points, that they abstract away the platform so you can concentrate on
building your own software. The problem is that now you have two systems
to learn, HTML+CSS+JS, and the framework. Sure, if the framework was a perfect
abstraction of the web as a platform you would never have to go beyond the
framework, but guess what, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">abstractions leak</a>.
So you need to know HTML+CSS+JS because at some point your program won&#39;t work the way you
expect it to, and you’ll have to dig down through all the layers in the
framework to figure out what&#39;s wrong, all the way down to HTML+CSS+JS.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Mapping the iceberg.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A framework is like an iceberg, that 10% floating above the water doesn&#39;t look
dangerous, it&#39;s the hidden 90% that will eventually get you. Actually it&#39;s
even more apt than that, learning a framework is like mapping an iceberg, in
order to use the framework you need to learn the whole thing, apply the effort
of mapping out the entire thing, and in the long run the process is pointless
because the iceberg is going to melt anyway.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Widgets</strong> Another selling point of frameworks is that you can
get access to a library of widgets. But really, you shouldn&#39;t need to adopt a
framework to get access to widgets, they should all be orthogonal and
independent. A good example of this today is <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>, a syntax highlighting code
editor built in JavaScript. You can use it anywhere, no framework needed.
</p>

<p>
There is also the lost effort of building widgets for a framework. Remember
all those MochiKit widgets you wrote? Yeah, how much good are they doing you
now that you&#39;ve migrated to Ember, or Angular?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data Binding</strong> <strike>Honestly I&#39;ve never needed it</strike>, but if you do, it
  should come in the form of a library and not a framework.
  <b>Update</b> Over the past 9 months I've started using data binding more and love
  it, but I'm sticking to my assertion that it should come in the form of a library.
  To prove my point, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcgregorio/7fa68cdced1181416559">
    here's an entire HTML templating library (one way binding) in exactly
    100 lines of JS</a>.

  <b>Update 2</b> That gist has now been cleaned up, documented, and published
  as its own library <a href="https://github.com/jcgregorio/stamp/">Stamp</a>.
</p>

<p>
The longer term problem with frameworks is that they end up being silos, they
segment the landscape, widgets built for framework A don&#39;t work in framework
B. That&#39;s lost effort.
</p>

<p>
So what does a post-framework world look like?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
HTML+CSS+JS are my framework.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The fundamental idea is that frameworks aren&#39;t needed, use the
capabilities already built into HTML+CSS+JS to build your widgets. Break apart
the monoliths into orthogonal components that can be mixed in any combination.
The final pieces that enable all of this fall under the umbrella of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/">Web Components</a>.
</p>

<p>
HTML Imports, HTML Templates, Custom Elements, and Shadow DOM are the enabling
technologies that should allow us to cut the cord from frameworks, allowing
the creation of reusable elements and functionality. For a much better
introduction see these articles and libraries: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/">HTML Imports</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">X-Tag</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://bosonic.github.io/">Bosonic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
So, we all create <a href="http://mozbrick.github.io/docs/brick-flipbox.html">&lt;x-flipbox></a>&#39;s, declare
victory, and go home?
</p>

<p>
No, not actually, the first thing you need for working with Web Components are
polyfills for that functionality, such as X-Tag and Polymer. The need for
those will decrease over time as browsers flesh out their implementations of
those specifications.
</p>

<p>
A point to be stressed here is that these polyfills aren&#39;t
frameworks that introduce their own models to developing on the web, they
enable the HTML 5 model. But that isn&#39;t really the only need, there are still
minor gaps in the platform where one browser deviates in a small way from
current standards, and that&#39;s something we need to polyfill.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN</a> seems to have
much of the needed code, as the documentation frequently contains
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility">
short per-function polyfills</a>.</p>

<p>
So one huge HTML 5 Polyfill library would be good, but even better would be
what I call <q>html-5-polyfill-o-matic</q>, a set of tools that allows me to write
Web Components via bog standard HTML+JS and then after analyzing my code,
either via static analysis or via <code>Object.observe</code> at runtime, it produces a
precise subset of the full HTML 5 polyfill for my project.
</p>

<p>
This sort of functionality will be even more important as I start trying to
mix and match web components and libraries from multiple sources, i.e. an
&lt;x-foo&gt; from X-Tag and a &lt;core-bar&gt; from Polymer, does that mean I should
have to include both of their polyfill libraries? (<a
href="http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/polymer-xtag-vanilla.html">It turns out the answer is
no</a>.) And how exactly should I get
these custom elements? Both X-Tag and Brick have custom bundle generators:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/brick/download.html">Brick Download</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/download">X-Tag Download</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
If I start creating custom elements do I need to create my own custom bundler
too? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a scalable idea, I believe we need idioms and tools
that handle this much better. This may actually mean changing how we do open
source; a &#39;widget&#39; isn&#39;t a project, so our handling of these things needs to
change. Sure, still put the code in Git, but do you need the full overhead of
a GitHub project? Something lighter weight, closer to a Gist than a current
project might be a better fit. How do I minimize/<a href="https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize">vulcanize</a> all of this code into the right form for
use in my project?  Something like <a href="https://github.com/assetgraph/assetgraph-builder">Asset Graph</a> might
be a good start on that.
</p>

<p>
So what do we need now?
</p>

<ol>
  <li id=tools1>
  Idioms and guidelines for building reusable components.
  </li>
  <li id=tools2>
  Tools that work under those idioms to compile, crush, etc. all that HTML, CSS, and JS.
  </li>
  <li id=tools3>
  A scalable HTML 5 polyfill, full or scaled down based on what&#39;s really used.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
That&#39;s what we need to build a future where we don&#39;t need to learn the
latest model of the newest framework, instead we just work directly with the
platform, pulling in custom elements and libraries to fill specific needs, and
spend our time building applications, not mapping icebergs.
</p>

<h2 id=qa>Q&amp;A</h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why do you hate framework authors.</p>
<p><b>A:</b> I don’t hate them. Some of my best friends are framework authors.
I will admit a bit of inspiration from the tongue-in-cheek
<a href="http://codeofrob.com/entries/you-have-ruined-javascript.html">you
have ruined javascript</a>, but again, no derision intended for framework authors.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> You can’t do ____ in HTML5, for that you need a framework.</p>
<p><b>A:</b> First, that&#39;s not a question. Second, thanks for pointing that
out. Now let&#39;s work together to add the capabilities to HTML 5 that allows
____ to be done w/o a framework.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> But ___ isn&#39;t a framework, it&#39;s a library!</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yeah, like I said, it’s a gradient from gist to framework, and
you might draw the lines slightly differently from me. That&#39;s OK, this isn&#39;t
about the categorization of any one particular piece of software, it&#39;s about
moving away from frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> I&#39;ve been doing this for years, with ___ and ___ and ___.</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Again, that&#39;s not a question, but regardless, good for you, you
should be in good shape to help everyone else.</p>

<p id=sam1><b>Q:</b> So everyone needs to rewrite dropdown menus, tabs, sliders and toggles themselves?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Absolutely not, the point is there should be a way to create
those elements in a way that doesn't require buying into one particular framework.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Dude, all those HTML Imports are going to kill my sites performance.</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, if you implemented all this stuff naively it would, which is
why I <a href="#tools2">mentioned the need for tools</a> to compile and crush all the HTML, CSS, and
JS.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> So I'm not supposed to use <em>any</em> libraries? </p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, that's not what I said, I was very careful to delineate a line between libraries and
frameworks, a library providing an orthogonal piece of functionality that can
be used with other libraries. Libraries are fine, it's the frameworks that
demand 100% buyin that I'd like to see us move away from.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> But I like data binding! </p>
<p><b>A:</b> Lot's of people do, I was only expressing a personal preference.
I didn't say that <em>you</em> shouldn't use data binding, but only that you don't need
to adopt an entire framework to get data-binding, there are standalone
libraries for that.
