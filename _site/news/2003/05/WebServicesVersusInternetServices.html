      <p>I think a new name is in order, "Internet Services" to distinguish
them from "Web Services".</p>
  <p>First let's discuss Web Services. The first person who comes
   to mind for this definition is <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/">Jon Udell</a>, who has been covering 
   the idea of hooking up various services on the web for a long time,
   most recently covering how to <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/05/27.html#a704">transform an RSS feed into HTML fit for
   a Nokia</a> which was done by <a href="http://clarity.awakeheart.net/archives/000233.html#000233">Robert Ivanc</a>, and how his bank
   could have used Web Services to fix his online account. </p>
<blockquote><p>But since 1994 or so, things have been different. Integrating two Web-based systems, if only 
  by brute force, is not only necessary but possible. If I can log in to both systems and drive them 
  interactively, I can write a script to join them programmatically. Every Web application can be tortured 
  into behaving like a Web service, 
  even when its creator never intended it to. [<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/05/23/21OPstrategic_1.html">Jon Udell</a>]
  </p></blockquote>
<p>To me that sums up Web Services, as a way to streamline such natural information flows. </p>
<p>Now, in contrast, I have been lurking on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws/">W3C Web Services</a> and the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/">W3C Web Services Architecture Working Group</a> mailing lists.
   As a side note, I think <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/">Mark Baker</a>, no matter what you think of his arguments, definitely 
   deserves a medal for persistence, as he tries to promote the REST architecture
   to the Web Services Architecture Working Group. Anyway, medals aside, I have been following the arguments
   and think that the term Web Services, and the actual goals of the majority of the people
   in the Working Group have little, or nothing, to do with the ideas Jon Udell is talking about.
   The group seems pretty centered on using SOAP via HTTP to connect big business databases
   together. As far as I can tell, this group would be much better off if they dropped HTTP
   and just started creating a <a href="http://www.beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> profile that incorporated SOAP, 
   which they could call "Internet Services" to differentiate themselves from "Web Services".</p>
<p>Now, back to Web Services, brings us to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011">Robert Scoble</a>, latest borg victim, is trying to 
   answer the question "Is IE Dead" while not <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/05/26.html#a3113">trying to break an NDA</a> ends up asking what
   people would like to see in a new version of IE. (See the comments to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/05/27.html#a3118">this post</a>.)
   Which got me to thinking, what is the least amount of innovation that would be necessary 
   to get Jon Udell's concept of Web Services up and running. That is, what's the minimum amount 
   of tweaking to the browser that could be made so that services could be designed to be 
   used from a browser, or programmatically. Here's the short list of changes: </p>
<ol>
<li>Add the ability for HTML forms to submit their data as "text/xml" in addition
      to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.3">"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</a>.
      This would be a half-way step between current HTML forms and <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a>, which is only supposed to make
      an appearance in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">XHTML 2.0</a>.</li>
<li>Also, have the optional ability for form values to be populated via XML. Now it looks like what I am asking for is XForms here, but
      I've looked at XForms and it is way too complex and too radical a departure from 
      current HTML forms that it won't be adopted anytime soon. There was no effort to leverage current
      developer skills, nor any effort to minimize breakage when migrating from HTML forms to XForms. </li>
</ol>
<p>That is the minimal list, if I were to go for the whole enchilada, I would also want:</p>
<ol>
<li>A native form element for editing HTML. A <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=3118#1947">long time request</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>.</li>
<li>The ability for HTML forms to use the "PUT" and "DELETE" methods in addition to the current "POST" and "GET" methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it, those are all the changes that would be needed 
   to support Jon Udell's concept of Web Services. These changes would make it dramatically
   easier to create Web Services that could be used either by a browser or programmatically.
   No SOAP, no WS-Security, no InfoPath, no XForms. Unfortunately, this has a zero percent chance
   of being implemented. In a way I wish we we're back in the days of the browser wars, at 
   least back then there's a chance at least one of the competitors would implement these 
   ideas just on the hope it would give them an edge. Now Microsoft dominates the browser scene
   and is unlikely to try anything innovative, and the W3C has moved well beyond this level
   of tinkering and is dealing with bigger and better things like RDF, XForms and XHTML 2.0.</p>

    (Sorry, finger/keyboard trouble on previous attempt).

Some of your thoughts on 'web' vs 'internet' reflect <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2002/05/20#webservices">very similar thoughts</a> I had too. Interestingly, it was on the cusp of me discovering REST which brought renewed focus (for me) on HTTP.
