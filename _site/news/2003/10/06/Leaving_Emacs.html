      <p>All other things being equal, avoid empowering lunatics.</p>

  <p>I have been an emacs user for close to 8 years now. That is about to end.
   After reading about <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/18/NXML">
   James Clark's new nXML Emacs XML editing mode</a>
   I decided to give it a try. Lo and behold it requires emacs 21.X and here I 
   was languishing in a backwater at 20.7.1. So I head off to <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/">
   ftp.gnu.org</a> to get the latest windows binaries for the latest release of emacs.
   But instead of finding binaries I found a slew of <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.3/">back-RSNs</a>.
   What, pray tell, are back-RSNs? Little text files explaining that the stuff you are
   looking for will be back Real Soon Now. They're gone because:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A root compromise and a Trojan horse were discovered on gnuftp.gnu.org,
the FTP server of the GNU project.  The machine appears to have been
cracked in March 2003, but we only discovered the crack in the last week
of July 2003. [<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/MISSING-FILES.README">MISSING-FILES.README</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a clue, <strong>one month does not qualify as Real Soon Now</strong>. 
   One month later and <em>all</em> the windows emacs binaries
   are still missing and so are the latest emacs sources.
   Both the slipshod detection and languid pace of repair make me think
   they're aiming to give Microsoft a run for their money on security.
   </p>
<p>I am now looking for a new text editor. I would prefer something I 
   could run on both Windows and unix boxes. Reasonably full featured and
   with a decent scripting language. Suggestions are welcome.</p>

    Maybe you should try XEmacs at www.xemacs.org - a <b>lot</b> better than plain Emacs, IMHO, and with a much nicer Look and Feel. Although, sadly enough, nXML mode is one of the very few packages that doesn't run in XEmacs.

<p>The security remark (and the thing about empowering lunatics, but that sort of goes without saying) seems to me to be really missing the point.  If they were aiming for that level of security they could have left the binaries and all the rest online for everybody to enjoy.</p>
<p>How they got hacked, how long it took them to find out they had been hacked and how they feel about things like root or the wheel group... Now there's something to discuss.</p>

    I can recommend Lugaru's Epsilon (http://www.lugaru.com). Inspired by Emacs, fast, fully featured, extensible, scripting language exactly like C.<br />

<p>SlickEdit is suppose to be good, runs on Windoze, Unix and Linux.  And it's developed in your backyard (Morrisville, NC).  Try the free demo and let me know how you like it...  Then maybe you can teach an old dog how to use it.</p>

    Many people are happy with other editors, and I can't say whether you would be better off with a different one, but this strikes me as a particularly dumb reason to switch.  There are a zillion places you can grab source or binaries of most major free software programs, including both flavors of emacs.

    <p>jEdit is nice (earlier <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Leaving_Emacs#X16">commented</a>)<br />
It runs on many platforms (A fine example of good Java coding).<br />
I use it on my Windows (work) and Linux, *BSD boxes (home), and I know people that use it on the MacOSes.</p>
<p>It runs in a GUI (not command-line), so stick with VIM if command-line is a requirement.</p>

    Why aren't there any editors that have anything close to Emacs cc-mode?  It seems like every editor I've found is like using notepad with syntax highliting.  When I hit tab on a line I want it to line up <em>exactly</em> where it should be lined up.  And how do Slickedit and Epsilon get $300 and $250 for their products.  I want a product I can afford to use at work and at home.  $100 would seem much more reasonable for a program like this.  Visio requires a lot more programming and costs less than a code editor.
