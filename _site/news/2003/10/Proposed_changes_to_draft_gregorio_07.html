  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I've been discussing search as being the most
  angst filled facet. After having tossed around a couple
  ideas, here is a concrete proposal for how to change
  the spec in the next revision. While I'm at it let's
  slip in another proposal for the 'createEntry' facet too.</p>
  <p>First, a quick review, the Introspection file lists 
   all the facets that an implementation of the AtomAPI
   implements.</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
   &lt;introspection xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#" &gt; 
     &lt;create-entry&gt;http://example.org/reilly/&lt;/create-entry&gt;
     &lt;user-prefs&gt;http://example.org/reilly/prefs&lt;/user-prefs&gt;
     &lt;search-entries&gt;http://example.org/reilly/search&lt;/search-entries&gt;
     &lt;edit-template&gt;http://example.org/reilly/templates&lt;/edit-template&gt;
     &lt;categories&gt;http://example.org/reilly/categories&lt;/categories&gt;
    &lt;/introspection&gt;     

</code></pre>
<p>The 'search-entries' facet, which is described in 
   <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-07.html#Model_Find">Secion 5.5 of the draft RFC</a>
   gets split into two
   different facets in the <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-07.html#rfc.section.5.1">Introspection file</a>. 
   Remove &lt;search-entries/&gt; and add in two new
   elements: &lt;recent-entries/&gt; and &lt;browse-entries/&gt;.</p>
<h3>recent-entries</h3>
<p> The recent-entries facet allows the client to retrieve information
   about the last N entries to the site. This will function just like 
   the 'search-entries' facet except that it will only accept one
   search parameter 'atom-last'. The 'atom-last' query parameter
   is set to the number of recent entries to return. It returns a file in the 
   same format as is currently specified for the 'search-entries' facet.</p>
<p>For example, if the 'recent-entries' element has the URI <code>http://example.org/recent/</code>
   for a value, then doing a GET on the URI:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>http://example.org/recent/?atom-last=2</code></pre>
<p>Will retrieve descriptions of the last 2 Entries. The results returned 
   would look like:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok 
Content-Type: application/x.atom+xml

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
&lt;recent-entries xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#" &gt; 
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Post&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/reilly/1&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Second Post&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/reilly/2&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/recent-entries&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Now there have been questions regarding the use of <code>id</code> and 
   <code>title</code> in the search results. The use of <code>id</code>
   isn't consistent with the use in the Atom format, or at least it could
   conflict with the use that the server implementation had chosen. <code>Title</code>
   is also a bit problematic in that an Entry may not have a title. Here is a 
   proposed alternative:

</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok 
Content-Type: application/x.atom+xml

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
&lt;recent-entries xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#" &gt; 
  &lt;resource&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;My First Post&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://example.org/reilly/1&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;/resource&gt;
  &lt;resource&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;My Second Post&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://example.org/reilly/2&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;/resource&gt;

&lt;/recent-entries&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>description</code> is a string that is to be displayed to the
   user when choosing an Entry to edit. It should contain enough
   information that the user can adequately distinguish between
   Entries. It could contain the title of the Entry if it had one,
   but that is just suggested practice and the server 
   completely determines the content of this
   element.</p>
<p>The <code>link</code> element contains the 'editEntry' URI for the 
   Entry being described.</p>
<h3>browse-entries</h3>
<p>The browse-entries facet contains a URI of a file in 
   'archive' format. This is the alternate search mechanism
    I discussed in <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Atom_Archive_Format">
    Reconsidering Search (Kinda) in the AtomAPI</a> and elaborated on further
    in <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg00763.html">a message
    to the atom-syntax mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Both the 'recent-entries' facet and the 'browse-entries' facet 
   are optional. This lets the implementation
   choose which, if any, searching mechanism works best.</p>
<h3>Hinting at a location </h3>
<p>The last proposed change is for the 'create-entry' facet. In this
   case I propose that the &lt;link&gt; element of the POSTed Entry
   can optionally be filled in with a relative URI path. The value of
   the &lt;link&gt; element can serve as a hint to the server on
   what URI to assign the Entry. This could be used by Blosxom to 
   determine the directory to place the entry. The link element
   is optional and the server may ignore its value when processing
   a POST to create a new Entry. Here is an example of a POST to
   create an Entry with the <code>link</code> tag filled in:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
POST /some-atom-cgi-handler.cgi HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x.atom+xml

&lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;/tech/pantherUpgrade.html&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Mac OS: less crap&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;content type="application/xhtml+xml" mode="xml"&gt;
        &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
           The NYT has a glowing
           article about the Panther upgrade to Mac OS X...
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;issued&gt;2003-10-23T08:17:00-04:00&lt;/issued&gt;
    &lt;modified&gt;2003-10-23T08:17:00-04:00&lt;/modified&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;

</code></pre>

    <p>Looking good. <br />
I'm not sure why recent-entries should be treated as a special kind of query, it seems like building in a limitation. Will we also need a last-weeks-entries element, for instance?</p>
<p>The modified entry list looks an improvement, but if you're talking about resources and their description, surely this could be modified a little so that it's also valid RDF. </p>
<p>Nice to see the introspection example is now valid RDF, btw.</p>
<p>Personally I'm not sure about the hint - it seems to me that decisions about location should be entirely down to the server, and if it goes in as a hint, it's only a matter of time before people build systems that rely on it.</p>

    <p>Danny,<br />
Â  Recent-entries is just a list of entries in reverse chronological order, so if you want to go back further in time you request more entries. What I am trying to get to is the simplest thing that could work for clients and not be too much of a burden for servers to implement.</p>
<p>Â  So what are the 'little' changes I can make to the entry list to make it valid RDF?</p>
<p>Â  The problem is that there are systemsÂ  such as Bloxsom that need the location to be specified. Any suggestions on where else that information could go?</p>

    <p>I'm quite concerned that the content and structure of the recent-entries and browse-entries data is so vaguely defined and explicitly left up to the server. This makes life difficult for a client app that wants to download a blog to local storage and allow the user to view and edit it. Such a client will want to give the user a lot of control over how to view data.</p>
<p>By contrast, the browse-entries format is about giving the server control, which means that a client app isn't sure what it's going to get. It really just wants a no-nonsense list of entries with all available metadata that it can use to populate its local database and UI. The more the server tries to get clever about what information to show and how to organize it, the more likely that the client app is going to have trouble extracting what it needs.</p>
<p>This also goes for the completely vague "description" field in the recent-entries results. A client app isn't going to know what to do with this. I guess the best guess is to shove it into the subject field of the incomplete entry; but that leads to the prospect that, after the user decides to view the entry and the client downloads its entire data, the subject will change suddenly. This doesn't make a lot of sense to the user.</p>
<p>IMHO Atom should just expose the raw data behind the blog to an application. Server-side fanciness and formatting should be left up to the CGI code that generates the HTML.</p>

    <p>"IMHO Atom should just expose the raw data behind the blog to an application."</p>
<p>We now have three suggested interfacesÂ  for how to choose an Entry to edit: the original multi-parameter search facet, theÂ  simplified 'recent-entries' search facet, and finally the a static page navigation (either in the RESTLog archive format I proposed or in Sam Rubys suggested navigation).</p>
<p>Do you have a concrete suggestion for an alternative mechanism?</p>

    <p class="commentByLine">Posted by

    <p>My understand is that the browse-entries provides a way to navigate entries in multiple dimensions (category, timeline, etc.) which are optionally and creatively determined and supported by the server implementation. Is this understanding correct?</p>
<p>It also seems, however, some of us (including myself) see the need for browsing (searching/navigation) entries remotely (on the entries on server) and locally (entries that are on user's local storage) uniformly using the same set of API's. Local entries include archived entries, drafted but not yet published entries, and also entries that are created and available on the server. It is, of course, possible, but the client implementation and the server implementation could not be decoupled.</p>
<p>I have not thought of an concrete alternative (though still trying...)</p>
