<p>One of my other new toys for Christmas was a 
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DB4D1/bitworking-20">Palm Tungsten E</a>. This is the lowest end of the Tungsten
   family and had the best price/feature mix of all the Palms
   I looked at. The rest of the models were a little too pricey for
   me, and the Zire line just felt to flimsy in my hands.
</p>
<p>I had never owned a Palm before and was a little concerned
   about "learning Grafitti", which is the way you write into a Palm.
   Turns out that wasn't a problem as Grafitti is exactly the
   way I write in print text, so there wasn't much to learn. Now the 
   special escaping you have to do for symbols like <code>$</code>, and <code>[</code>
   is a bit odd, but I caught on quickly and the palm has help for that
   built in. Just drag the stylus across the length of the whole screen from 
   top to bottom and the writing help pops up.</p>
The Tungsten E is different from most of the Palm models in that it doesn't
   use a cradle, which for me was big plus. Instead it just plugs into the USB port, 
   which allows synchronization. I always thought
   the cradle was a bit akward, and since I am syncing at both home and the office 
   I just need two cheap USB cables and not two cradles. It also allows me to lie 
   the Tugsten E flat on the table and not have it standing up looking 'interesting', 
   an oft over looked but important point when you have small children running
   around the house.
<p>The only minor complaint I have about the E was in playing music. I 
   apparently skimmed the site too quickly when reading about the features
   and saw that the E could be used as an MP3 player, which is true, but you
   need to buy an additional memory card to store the tracks as you can't use
   the onboard memory. It wasn't expensive, $30 for a 32MB memory card, since I 
   don't really intend on carrying around an extensive music collection, but 
   more an annoyance that I had to order it seperately because the on-line 
   Palm site didn't make that terribly clear.</p>
<p>The Palm has also come in handy in two respects with the adopotion. The first is
  that I can store photos on the E making it easy to update as new photos come in. The 
  second is having a easily searchable place to store all the stuff we will 
  need as we travel in China including itinerary, flights, currency conversion, phone numbers,
  and of course games to play while we wait. My current addition being a nice little Yahtzee game, which
  is the only piece of software I have added to the Palm so far. There is 
  a ton of software available, from free software like the Yahtzee game to many commercial 
  packages. One of the more intersting ones to me are the city transportation maps and 
  train/bus schedules that are available for major cities. All in all a handy little device
  that has quickly become indespensible to me.</p>

    Where do you get another USB cable for the Tungsten E ? I've checked with Palm and they say they are not avalible yet.

    I mis-spoke on that point. The USB Cable is just a standard USB peripheral cable that works for synchronizing. You still have to use the wall-wart for re-charging the Tungsten E.

    I just went out this morning to dick smith electronics intending to buy a Palm Zire 71. When I was having a look at the Palms, out of the corner of my eye I spotted the Tungsten E. I had a look at the features and compared them with the Zire 71 and decieded that the Tungsten E was best for me. In a matter of 4 hours  have Installed all that is needed and I am listning to Mp3's and watching movies and all systems go. I think that the Tungsten E is great.

    To get the graffiti Help, you need to drag from "bottom" to "top", not as you stated from top to bottom. Tried it over &amp; over as you described, till I decided to do the opposite and bingo, it appeared.

Lovely PDA. The power button is sited wrongly, though. It is turned off-and-on easiily as you reach for the stylus.

    I am interested in becoming a first-time PDA owner, but I am on a limited budget.  The Tungsten E sounds like a very good purchase, but I was wondering if there were any good deals out there?  Or is it a standard $199 everywhere?

Thanks.

    James,
  It does appear that the Tungsten E does trickle charge from the USB connection, I've done this myself and have found references to it on the net, but I find it odd that the PDF manual that comes with the E doesn't mention this at all.

    Jason, if the battery dies completely 
then the E will lose it's memory. I haven't found that to be a problem since I just leave the E charging on the USB port every night, and if it does lose all it's memory you just need to sync back up to your desktop.

    One tip I have for fellow tungsten E users.

If your battery life seems to be poor, try doing a hard reset whilst the charger is plugged in. This resets the battery-reporting feature and you get a more accurate representation of battery life.

I'm using my Tungsten E for MSN messenger and web access on the move with my GPRS Siemens SL55 and love it!

    Hello Everybody, I'm new to this PDA world. I've read that Sony's Clie PEG-TJ35 is equally good. Have read loads of reviews comparing both, but still could not make up my choice :-(  My only concern with Palm PDAs is the fact that many of them, after a year or two, start having digitizer problems.  Can anyone comment on this?

    Hi:

I purchased a Palm Tungsten E today and installed the disc. I have tried at least a dozen times to synch my Palm to my Dell Inspiron 4100 laptop, and it will not work. The Palm support website is not very user friendly. Any suggestions?

Thank you in advance for your help.

    Hey. I hope the people who mentioned being interested in getting this haven't done it yet: I got one this week on overstock.com for $120, after a $10 link discount, now expired, I believe (but try techbargains.com for another one). The base price has also gone up for the blemished ones, which is what I got, from $130 to $145. So you might not be able to get such a good deal now.

I'm very happy with my "blemished" one, came with everything you'd get in the box, and not really blemished, as far as I can see. Maybe a couple of scratches that would have appeared in the first few days of use anyway. Just arrived loose in some bubble wrap. I'm happy. Beats buying a graphing calculator for $20 less.

    I just bought a Tungsten E a few days ago and I LOVE IT!!! I was looking for a non expensive PDA but with good tools to work with (like Documents to Go), so i found the E and it's really great. Pablo, Documents to Go is in the installation CD, you must install it after installing Palm Desktop, and really works fine.

    I bought a Tungsten E six weeks ago and agree it is a beautiful PDA. <br />
BUT after 6 (six) calls to the Help Line PDA and a letter to the CEO NOONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TELL ME HOW TO HOT SYNC IT VIA THE USB CABLE. Under their instruction I have unistalled and then reloaded the software over and over again and made all sorts of other adjustments. I have Windows XP Home. I keep getting the same error message "the connection between your handheld computer and the desktop could not be established" over and over again.. One thing, when I click the 'hotsync' icon at the bottom right hand corner of my desktop it does NOT have "usb". It just has "network", "modem" and "local serial" on the drop down list. Do you think they packaged the wrong software? And if so why won't Palm send me the correct software despite my asking them to? <br />
All advice most welcome. I'm getting desperate.

    Purchased a Tungsten E and a 128 MByte SD card. I am trying to load MP3 files onto the device via the Quick Load. When I initiate Hot Syn the tranferring starts but does not stop. Am I doing this correctly or better yet what is the correct way to load and play MP3 files. <br />

    I've had my T/E for just over a week and I've got to say that after my IIIxe, I'm really disappointed. <br />
My gripe is the battery life which is totally pathetic. <br />
I got over a week on 2 AAA batteries with the old Palm and with the E I'm lucky to get 3 hours. This means that I'm limited to how much I can use the device when I'm away from either a PC or a powerpoint. I've had to go back to the old Palm on more than a few occasions already.<br />
Apart from the battery issue, I really like it. It's got a nice "feel" to it and the screen (which probably drains the battery...) is superb.

    Sue B, You can enhance your battery life by doing the following:<br />
1. Keep the screen brightness at its lowest level. This is adequate in most situations. 2. Try setting the keylock to automatic (Preferences, General, Keylock) in case you T/E is accidently getting powered up in your pocket.<br />
3. Set the Beam Receive to OFF (Preferences, Power). You may also want to reduce the number of minutes for Auto-off after.

<p>I have a T.E with windows XP and I hotsyncs okay. However everytime I have gotten a Palm (or helped a friend with the setup) the Hotsync never worked first time.</p>
<p>1. Ensure that the Local Hotsync option on the Tungsten is setup to Cradle/cable.</p>
<p>2. Try each USB port on your computer.</p>
<p>3. Try changing the COM port of the desktop software (right-click on the desktop hotsync icon, then Setup, Local, then change the COMn to a different port, try all ports listed).</p>
<p>Keep a log of all combinations you have tried, so that you don't miss anything.</p>

    Argh!  I'm about to flip my lid!  I'm on my second Tungsten E.  I loved it to begin with, but am now having problems with the second one.  The first one died completely.  I'm trying to get rid of a hot sync clitch and am not having any success.  I'm also having problems trying to delete programs only to have them be updated with a new hot sync. <br />
  I would like to do a hard reset, however it is not clear how to do this.  I can get the screen up that asks me to press the UP button to perform the hard reset.  There is no UP button on an E???  What IS the up button???  Every button I've tried merely stops the hard reset.  I have spent 4 hours trying to resolve this so far tonight.  grr grr

    <p>My wife recently got a Tungsten E. I was very glad at this as she is normaly a technophobe. I set it up for her and let her loose. </p>
<p>She would comaplin to me alot that it would crash all the time. At first I thought that it was her. I have now tried to resolve the matter for her and have come to the conclusion that it is the device at fault.</p>
<p>The device would lock up for no reason and not powerdown or up, even when fully charged.</p>
<p>I have performed a hard reset (after 3 hours of trying) and even before a hotsync the device will crash even when charging. </p>
<p>I have been in contact with Palm and all they will offer is a reconditioned unit . This is after huge hassles to get any reply at all. The unit is 40 days old!  I europe there is by law a 2 year warranty on all electronic items sold. I feel deeply insulted by the resposne from Palm. Looking across many forums this is a common problem yet they think that they can avoid their responsibilty to customers. </p>
<p>I think that it is disgraceful that they attempt to dump defective goods on the general public. </p>

    <p>My Tungsten E went completely blank the other day. It was supposed to be recharging at the time. I couldn't get any of the buttons to respond. No hard reset; soft reset etc. Anyway I plugged it into to my USB port on my computer as a last resort and voila, it was charged up and was OK. It appears that the port for recharging thru the wall-charger is dead or defective. I'll try another cable if I can get one and see what happens. All my installed apps were gone and the PDA was back to the base settings but I prefer that to a dead PDA. I can easily re-install the apps, pictures etc. from backup.</p>
<p>BTW. a hard reset is done by holding the power button and inserting a paper clip or similar into the "reset" hole at the back of the PDA. A soft reset is done by inserting abovementioned clip into the "reset" hole at the back of the PDA.</p>

    About MP3s<br />
Regards MP3 do not send them using hot synch, for some reason it takes forever (which makes me think the USB is 1.1 not 2). Instead use the real player. Download it from www.realplayer.com. Install it on your laptop or desktop, turn on your palm and be sure the usb cable is attached to your computer and palm, select the songs you want to transfer and voila. It FLIES!<br />
Now if you are a geek (like me) go to the option's panel and select conever mp3 to rma. That will conver the mp3 file that is gonna be send to your palm which will save a lot of space (more songs will fit your expansion card) but it WON'T alter the original file on your computer.<br />

    <p>How come when I do the hard reset, all my programs are still there? </p>
<p>I did press the power button while placing a pin at the back to the reset button but once it boots back up, it's as if nothing happened. All my programs are still there.</p>

    <p>My PLAM TUNGSTEN E does not turn on with any button. But however when I soft/hard reset it, it turn on then again turns off after about 5 secs. I tried connecting it to the wall charger but still it does not turn on. Any Ideas?</p>
<p>PALM gives only 3 months warranty on these what a shame for paying 200$ you just get 3 months? I would have not bought this if I knew about the low warranty period</p>

    <p>Exactly same symptoms as bnbraj (2005-06-23). Yesterday my Tungsten E began turning itself off "automatically" following hard (pinhole) resets. The power button doesn't turn the machine on, but the reset button causes it to begin resetting. It stays on for a total of about five seconds, as bnbraj mentioned. This is enough time to show the "Palm Powered" and "Tungsten" startup screens and proceed to the stylus calibrating target screen before turning off. It turns off after approximately one second in the stylus targeting program. If I begin the stylus calibration procedure immediately, or if I exit this program, or if I push a button (Home, HotSynch, etc.), the machine behaves perfectly normally for about one second, then powers off. It is as if the "go to sleep" power off function were set to one second.</p>
<p>Here are more interesting wrinkles:</p>
<p>If I power off using the power button during the one second of normal operation, the machine turns off normally. I can then power on as usual with the power button; the machine starts where it left off in the stylus calibration program and operates normally for whatever is left of the one second, then shuts down. The power button becomes non-responsive again, and I am back to square one!</p>
<p>If I hold the power button in and hard reset, the machine stays at the "Palm Powered" screen until I release the power button, then prompts "Erase all data? / Yes='up button / No=any other button" Whichever option I choose, I still get about one second of normal operation before shutdown.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any help or insight from anybody. I am freaked out not to have my trusty and heretofor durable E.</p>

    <p>Possible solution to problem with Tungsten E:</p>
<p>Following up my previous post, I did some more research online, tried a few suggestions, and came up with something that makes me hopeful that the problem is fixed (time will tell if it is permanent.)</p>
<p>The problem, again, was that my Tungsten E would not turn on with the power button, and would stay on for only about five seconds after a hard reset. Nothing I tried altered this fundamental behavior until I tried the following:</p>
<p>1. Power adapter plugged in.</p>
<p>2. Hold in power button and perform hard (pinhole) reset. Release power button.</p>
<p>Message appears telling you that your battery is dead and that you need to charge it for several hours. With the power adapter connected, the on/off switch now works normally, and you can begin to restore your system or whatever.</p>
<p>It seems likely that if I had followed this procedure in the first place, I would not have lost any data. As things are, in the process of trying to get the thing to work, I erased all my data. Glad it's backed up.</p>
<p>The best explanation I have read for all of this (also posted here, by Joe, on 2004-02-13), is that, with age, the performance of the battery and/or charger changes enough that the circuits that sense battery status get discombobulated and need to be recalibrated, which is accomplished by reset with power connected. I don't recall reading this in any Palm documentation, but if they get $125 to make this 'repair' they may not have a motivation to do so.</p>
<p>Hope this helps somebody.</p>

    My E was the perfect work horse. Connected to my car stereo for a great MP3 player. Put my homework on the Word and Powerpoint.  Used it the other day, had dollar bills inside the cover and noticed the screen was "clicking" and thought I had the pressure off the screen. Now won't come on at all. Did all the resets, opened the case and the battery checks out. Anyone else know what I could have done to it, or any other thing to try?
