       <p>For some historical perspective on what a SARS pandemic
could be like if it is not contained, the influenza pandemic of 1918
is a good place to start.</p>
<blockquote><p> The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed more people than the 
  Great War, known today as World War I (WWI), at somewhere between 20 and 40 
  million people. It has been cited as the most devastating epidemic in recorded 
  world history. More people died of influenza in a single year than in four-years 
  of the Black Death Bubonic Plague from 1347 to 1351. Known as "Spanish Flu" or "La Grippe" 
  the influenza of 1918-1919 was a global disaster. [<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/uda/">The Influenza Pandemic of 1918</a>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly, 20,000,000 to 40,000,000 people died 
from that pandemic. Other pertinent quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p> The flu was most deadly for people ages 20 to 40. This pattern of morbidity was unusual for influenza which is usually a killer of the elderly and young children.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> The influenza virus had a profound virulence, with a mortality rate at 2.5% compared to the previous influenza epidemics, which were less than 0.1%. </p></blockquote>
<p>And yes, 1918 was the year this childs rhyme came on the scene:</p>
<blockquote><pre>    I had a little bird, 
    Its name was Enza. 
    I opened the window, 
    And in-flu-enza. </pre></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I feel kind of odd that this post has become the number 
one result on google when you search for <code>SARS</code> and <code>pandemic</code>.
So, to make this more helpful, if you find any useful links on SARS please leave
them in the comments below, and I will update this story as appropriate. Thanks, -joe</p>

    Joe,

I do see a possible common thread behind the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic and what's going on currently with SARS.   I caution you, ahead of time, that the connection is "far out."

http://www.ebicom.net/~rsf1/vel/1918.htm

If you go to the webpage mentioned above, please see "USA Influenza Activity 2002-2003, part 2."
It gets into the SARS problem.

    Interestingly, there was a time that any epidemic could have been called "influenza". See:

    I lost a great aunt to the influenza of 1918  My Question is this,  Could it go into a dormant stage as the weather moderates for the next few months, and we have summer in the U.S.?  only to come back this fall with a vengance as it did in 1918.  I have read it actually came in two waves during 1918/1919  the second wave being the most deadly by far. Very truly yours  Bob Weaver.  P.S.  Let me know what you all think.

    Have you all seen this? SARS appears to be "heating up." Mutations of the virus found on Hong Kong appear to have mortality rate of over 10% as opposed to 4% last month and around 2% in February.

    My great-grandfather died from the third wave of the super-flu in the spring of 1919. My grandfather was only three at the time and never had the chance to know his father. An exceptionally virulant strain of flu appears about once a century. I believe that there is a connection between SARS and the super-flu.

    I use the American Experience video every year in my classroom for my 9th graders.Â  A few years back there was an article in the New Yorker magazine which suggested that scientists are looking at the remains of several Noregian sailors who died and were buried above the artic circle in the hopes of learning more about the disease's dna.Â  That may be a way to look into what is being done, now.

    The flu epidemic was so stronmg as it occurred at teh tail end of world war one. Indeed all the calims about how it was caused fall upon world war one. Whether it was caused by the weakening of populations of world war one, and movement of doctors to fight on the front, or cure there. Plus by the weakening of the population as of the massive social chanmges caused by enrollment, THere are soem claims, it was actualloy started among the unnaturally crowded movements of world war one trenches, of people lieing in teh mud, weaked, edn and wounded, helping disease thrive. Then mass troop movements totally unchecked at times helped it's spread and the fact thatit spread during world war one, The state of war caused little international co-operation, and also saw the disease able to become rampant in areas, and from this a disease spawned which was sent right round the world. Infecting most terribly the poorest and most poverty stricken areas.
