<blockquote><p>
<b>Funarg</b> is an abbreviation for "functional argument"; 
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, the <b>funarg problem</b> relates to the

</p></blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about this in the context of the <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/321/The-Professionalization-of-Scripting-Languages">Professionalization of Scripting Languages</a>,
  does anyone know if any of the processor manufacturers are working on adding silicon 
  support for activation records?

  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    Well, if they think this problem is peculiar to stack-based programming-language implementations, they should consider the difficulty of non-stack-based programming-language implementations.  What a strange thought.

There were ALGOL 60 implementations, and of course PL/I in its odd way, that had to deal with the cactus problem.  The Funarg problem is easier to solve than the coroutine and multiple-thread cross-communication problems.  

In a way, the creation of objects with garbage-collected lifecycles provides an implementation mechanism for closures too.  The pain is that the caller has to be aware that a closure (method on a class instance) is being invoked, and it is usually difficult to pass an instance method around as if it were a function or procedure reference.

The idea with closures is that the recipient of one (say, as a parameter) doesn't know they are any different than any other function-like thingy that can be invoked, applied to arguments, etc.

Now that there are lambda-expressions in .NET, I suppose it would be useful to see if they get the closures right or even lead to properly-bound closures.  Time to resuscitate Knuth's ManOrBoy compiler test and try it out with the various scripting-language funarg provisions.

I would not pray for a silicon solution.  The tendency of hardware guys who do this has been to yield instant designs that don't actually work and have to be worked around with software anyhow.  I would treat that as a later optimization.  The big thing is figuring out how to handle lexical binding from a closure into its environment.
