      <p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">William Gibson</a>'s first three novels take place in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sprawl">the Sprawl, aka BAMA</a>, the Boston-Atlanta
Metropolitan Axis, a fictional future mega-city that extends from Boston down to
Atlanta. Now we're about half way there today
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BosWash">BosWash</a> already exists. 
I've now seen some recent signs that the 
southern extension is happening.</p>
<p> The first and most obvious
is the rapid growth in the Raleigh-Durham area; we've been
adding 3,000 people a month for the last several years.
The second is Namolis, a new pizza place just up the road from
our house, advertised as 'New York' pizza,
and let me tell you, it is; the whole restaurant smells
like New York, and the place is wildly popular, there's
regularly a line at the register and all the tables are 
filled. We have a large enough population of BosWash emigrees
now that we can support restaurants and the other services
we miss from our former lives - I fully expect a real bagel shop to open up any day now.
The final sign is that <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6305905">
Amtrak is proposing a high-speed limited stop line that
will connect D.C., Richmond, Raleigh, Charlotte, and Atlanta</a> to open in 2017, thus 
making the whole of BAMA just a train stop away.
</p>
  <div class="commentContent" id="X1">
    The Charlotte-Atlanta run is still a big trip through nowhere. Speaking to the spread of "Atlanta" though, I expect in the near future Chattanooga and Birmingham to basically become part of Atlanta anyway. Since Adairsville is now basically a suburb of Atlanta and Dalton of Chattanooga, there is only a few miles separating each metro. 

Just given the commute patterns, it seems like going to Charlotte would be a bad idea for Amtrak. If I were going to connect cities, I would certainly go ATL-&gt;Chat-&gt;Knox-&gt;RDU-&gt;Richmond. Charlotte is a big air hub, yes, but there is a lot more regular movement in the GA-TN direction and that is the current growth direction of the Atlanta metro.

    Charlotte already has two Amtrak runs, thank you.
