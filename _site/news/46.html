  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">XForms</a> doesn't support the DELETE verb. 
  Do you want the long version or the short version?</p>

<dt>Long Version</dt>
<dd>I have had it confirmed that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">XForms</a> 
   does not support the DELETE verb. It does not support any verbs besides GET, PUT and POST.
   This comes from the specfication trying to be too general. That is, XForms was designed not
   to just be used on a web page and submit over HTTP but to also work
   on <code>file:</code> and <code>mailto:</code> URIs. To make that work the method you
   specify isn't "GET" but instead "get", which your XForms processor needs to <em>map</em>
   to the right HTTP verb if you are going over HTTP. The problem with that design
   decision, that reach for too much generality, is that in order for an XForms processor
   to support another verb, the processor itself had to be changed. So it looks like a fully 
   conformant XForms processor will not be able to support 
   <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/news/5">RESTLog</a>, nor will it be able to support
   WebDAV, which uses verbs like MKCOL, COPY, etc.</dd>
