  I was tagged by <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/12/12/that-was-quick/">Peter Lacy</a>. Here are five things
  you probably don't know about me:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>I have four - <a href="http://bitworking.org/images/2006/12/kids.jpg">count them, four</a> - children. </li>
<li>I can dumbbell bench-press 200 lbs. (There's just not a lot of opportunity
        to share that in casual conversation without sounding like a meat head.)</li>
<li>At a previous job I wrote a complete Windows C++ STL-based GUI library which will never see the light of day
     since that division no longer exists. (Hooray for closed source!)</li>
<li>At the age of 14 I could dress a pig. (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dress">See definition #14 for 'dress'.</a>)</li>
<li>I apparently have the same exact taste in TV as <a href="http://www.majordojo.com/hodge_podge/five_things.php">Byrne</a>. 
      (Well, I appear to be one show ahead of 
       him since he didn't list <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Dr. Who</a>.)
  </li></ul>
<p>Outgoing tags: 
  <a href="http://sudsblog.com/">Sudhir</a> (Whom I used to work with.)
  <a href="http://16cards.com/">Brandon</a> (Whom I now work with), 
     <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/">Phil</a> (Who needs an excuse to knock the dust off the old blog), 
     <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">Ted</a> (Whom I haven't talked to since ETech), and finally
     <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark</a> (Who thankfully won't actually respond and thus
     bring this silly thing to an end).
