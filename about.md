![Joe Gregorio](/images/joe2016.jpg)

My name is Joe Gregorio and I am the father of three boys and one girl and a
husband to Lynne Gregorio. We live in sunny North Carolina where I work for
Google on the [Skia](https://skia.org) graphics library. I am the editor of
the Atom Publishing Protocol and the coauthor of the URI Templates spec. I
have a deep interest in web technologies: I wrote The RESTFul Web column for
the online Oâ€™Reilly publication XML.com, wrote the first desktop aggregator
written in C#, and have published various Python modules to help in putting
together RESTful web services such as mimeparse, httplib2, and the
google-api-python-client. I'm is interested in Go, Polymer, Web Components,
REST, web services, APIs, URI templates, the Atom Publishing Protocol, big
data, and any linear combination of such.

employer's positions, strategies or opinions.
